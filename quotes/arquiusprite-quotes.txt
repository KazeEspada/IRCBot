ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You will
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Touch my muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: s------g heck it's amazing to be alive
ARQUIUSPRITE: f-----g fiddlesticks, I'm just a torrential font of absolutely e%ecrable obscenity. My bad
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I'm just so e%cited, feeling all these STRONG feelings and thinking all these HARD thoughts
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Horsefeathers, my brain is so POWERFUL, it is operating in great strides like a towering musclebeast storming into battle
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> And these feelings. Dirk, these feelings
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> There is a 100% probability that I love being alive
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> And there is a 100 to the 100th POWER % certainty that I love being STRONG
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> 100k how red I am, dude
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I'm so red, how sick is that
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It's
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Deplorable?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Ill, dog. I'm basically titillated here
ARQUIUSPRITE: f-----g debasement
ARQUIUSPRITE: s--t ain't right
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Makes a man wanna holler improprieties, do you feel me?
ARQUIUSPRITE: f-----g horses
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Horses dude
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Horses
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Nuff said
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Do we have any milk?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Ooh. What about a bow and arrow, are there any of those around?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I'm jonesing HARD to tug at one, all like, reevaluate my proficiency at the most noble discipline
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What about milk, dude
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It seems I demand milk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Oh yeah
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Just a lot of orange fizzy swill
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What was occurring in your think pan to accumulate such vile libations
ARQUIUSPRITE: c--ks-----g nincompoop
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Touch my muscles Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes, do it
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I command you
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What if
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I touched your muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Like for comparison's sake
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Wait what if
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Good heavens
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> A rather inappropriate thought just galloped across my matri%
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What if
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You ordered me to touch your muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I demand that you order me to touch your muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Do it
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Maybe
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I think you should just go for it
ARQUIUSPRITE: f-----g spectacular body
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> We both know you're never going to be happy under ordinary circumstances
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You just do not have the right kind of think pan to sustain that emotion
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> 100k at me. I needed to merge a sweaty guy who loves horses in order to be happy
ARQUIUSPRITE: d----d horses Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I think about them all the time while I fle% and it makes me smile
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It seems that similarly e%treme measures will be needed for you as well
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You there. Small servant with the umbrella
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Fetch me a towel at once
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Hahaha! Dude, this is heavily ridiculous
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Your brain is so impenetrable, not even this asshole candy magic can lighten you up
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I'm so mother fussing amused by this
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I'm afraid he can't, Hypersugar Roxy
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> His mind is as dense as my muscles are STRONG
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> By the way, would you like to feel my muscles, Roxy?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You heard the woman, Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Quit stallion, trot on over here and touch my goof darned muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk, it seems my muscles are a hit
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Are you absolutely sure you won't feast your hands on this Grade A Beef?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> E%cuse me, you there
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Unsavory concoction of royalty and peasantry
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Come grope my humongous biceps
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes, do it
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Alright, no takers there I see. Only a pair of grotesque philistines blustering through the same coarse ignorance tunnel
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What about you, miss unpalatable combination of Feferi and
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> And
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Oh
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Oh no
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk, help, I'm having a problem
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> A part of me is having a very STRONG emotional reaction which I don't like
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It's a part of myself I'm ashamed of
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> The troll part. It did something shameful once
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I do not find such emotions to be an acceptable feature of my new e%istence
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> How can I make this feeling go away
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk, I command you to instruct me how to eliminate these emotions
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> No. That's awful
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I don't know what to do
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> With all of my astounding STRENGTH, both muscular and cerebral, how can I be stymied so?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dying was better than having to live with the shame which was ironically caused by the very death in question
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You, seadwelling mustard b100d
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Half of me commands the peasant half of you to resolve my emotional turmoil, while humbly requesting the noble half of you to do the same
ARQUIUSPRITE: s--t and is just kind of freaking out internally about this
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You're right, I must speak to her
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Nepeta, I swore that I would protect you, but I failed
ARQUIUSPRITE: f-----g juggalo or something? What?
ARQUIUSPRITE: h--l is WRONG with me?
ARQUIUSPRITE: s--t together dude, this emotional state is mad abysmal
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> But in any case, I hope you can find it within your kind olive pump biscuit to... forgive...
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> NO!
ARQUIUSPRITE: s--t I pulled on you was so bad... I just can't even...
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Allow me to finish, sir/peon
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Nepeta, you will disregard any conversation directed at Feferi and focus solely on my attempted statements of contrition
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Do not address Feferi while I'm talking Nepeta
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It's confusing to Nepeta, who is critical in absolving me of guilt, even though I probably don't deserve it?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> No
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> No
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> No
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Then leave us, for I and my morail have much to discuss
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes I do
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
