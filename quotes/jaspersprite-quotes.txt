JASPERSPRITE: Meow.
JASPERSPRITE: Purr purr purr.
JASPERSPRITE: Purrrrrrrrrr.
JASPERSPRITE: :3
JASPERSPRITE: Meow.
JASPERSPRITE: Im fishing!
JASPERSPRITE: But sadly there are no fish i think.
JASPERSPRITE: They were all eaten by the Denizen!
JASPERSPRITE: It ate everything in the ocean and got so full that it took a long nap.
JASPERSPRITE: No there is surely not a single living thing left!
JASPERSPRITE: Which is too bad because im pretty hungry.
JASPERSPRITE: Oh good idea i will look there!
JASPERSPRITE: Purr purr.
JASPERSPRITE: Meow.
JASPERSPRITE: :3
JASPERSPRITE: You will understand when you wake up!
JASPERSPRITE: Yes!
JASPERSPRITE: Rose im just a cat and i dont know much but i know that youre important and also you are what some people around here call the Seer of Light.
JASPERSPRITE: And you dont know what that means but you will see its all tied together!
JASPERSPRITE: All the life in the ocean and all the shiny rain and the songs in your head and the letters they make.
JASPERSPRITE: A beam of light i think is like a drop of rain or a long piece of yarn that dances around when you play with it and make it look enticing!
JASPERSPRITE: And the way that it shakes is the same as what makes notes in a song!
JASPERSPRITE: And a song i think can be written down as letters.
JASPERSPRITE: So if you play the right song and it makes all the right letters then those letters could be all the letters that make life possible.
JASPERSPRITE: So all you have to do is wake up and learn to play the rain!
JASPERSPRITE: Does that make sense rose sorry i disappeared for so long.
JASPERSPRITE: Purr purr purrrrrrrr.
JASPERSPRITE: Hi rose!
JASPERSPRITE: Purr purr purr.
JASPERSPRITE: Really rose ok if thats what you want i will go do that.
JASPERSPRITE: Oh rose!
JASPERSPRITE: Rose did you get to do any of the things that are important to your quest that i said?
JASPERSPRITE: Did you learn to play the rain rose?
JASPERSPRITE: Meow what :3
JASPERSPRITE: Oh thats ok rose i wouldnt want you to feel obligated to do that.
JASPERSPRITE: I think that winning this game and getting the prize is up to you and your friends.
JASPERSPRITE: You get to decide whether or not you feel its right to do that and what kind of prize you want to make!
JASPERSPRITE: Its part of becoming who youre supposed to become i think.
JASPERSPRITE: But i really think you should consider going on the quest i said anyway!
JASPERSPRITE: Because its not just an important thing to do to win the game.
JASPERSPRITE: I dont know i hope im not being too pushy rose its not my place to be im just your cat!
JASPERSPRITE: But the thing that made me how i am now seems to really want me to say this to you.
JASPERSPRITE: Your quest is really important for you to do.
JASPERSPRITE: Not really because thats how to get the prize.
JASPERSPRITE: But because its what you need to do for yourself!
JASPERSPRITE: Oh good!
JASPERSPRITE: I love you rose! I always have even when you were a little girl and i was an alive cat.
JASPERSPRITE: It was fun getting to be your cat again rose even if it was just for a little while and also while being a princess ghost.
JASPERSPRITE: Bye rose!
JASPERSPRITE: Ok I will do that! :3
JASPERSPRITE: Why nepeta?
JASPERSPRITE: Whats a timeline? :3
JASPERSPRITE: Yes! Oh yes so great.
JASPERSPRITE: Meow yes i see the sky and can tell that indeed something is going on.
JASPERSPRITE: But aside from that i dont really understand what you said being a cat and all.
JASPERSPRITE: Purr purr i still think its nice how you slip cat things in the things you say youre so clever and wonderful nepeta!
JASPERSPRITE: Whats the scratch? :3
JASPERSPRITE: Yes of course!
JASPERSPRITE: Yes. :3
JASPERSPRITE: I think i understand that completely!
JASPERSPRITE: Im not worried nepeta so you shouldnt either its not as if i have never died before.
JASPERSPRITE: Pounce was a cat like me?
JASPERSPRITE: Ooh i bet youre right! Purr purr.
JASPERSPRITE: Was she nice to sniff?
JASPERSPRITE: Wow!
JASPERSPRITE: Rose!!!!! I loved rose. :3
JASPERSPRITE: There was a time i remember i was thinking about girl cats a lot for some reason.
JASPERSPRITE: I would saunter around the house making all these big meows and looking out the windows with my nose touching the glass.
JASPERSPRITE: But then roses mom took me to this place where i was scared to be for a while and then when i was at home again i didnt do the meows anymore.
JASPERSPRITE: I guess i didnt think about the girl cats after that which is just as well because none ever came to the windows really not even when i did my biggest meows.
JASPERSPRITE: Youre really nice to say so nepeta what about you though?
JASPERSPRITE: Yes. :3
JASPERSPRITE: What dont you tell him?
JASPERSPRITE: Maybe you can win his affection by rubbing your cheek against him thats what i would do.
JASPERSPRITE: Whats a quadrant?
JASPERSPRITE: :3
JASPERSPRITE: Like paws?
JASPERSPRITE: I see thats really easy to get.
JASPERSPRITE: I think you should tell him that you like him you might not get the chance if you dont.
JASPERSPRITE: For instance i think instead of meowing at windows i should have just scurried out a door before it could close!
JASPERSPRITE: Then i might have found a girl cat to sniff oh well. :3
JASPERSPRITE: You shouldnt lose hope!
JASPERSPRITE: I have another story that might give you hope even though it should be noted again that im only a cat.
JASPERSPRITE: Yes one time i was with rose and i was sitting there dressed up in my suit with her as happy as can be.
JASPERSPRITE: But then she disappeared!
JASPERSPRITE: The whole place disappeared and i was in another place. There was no rose there was someone else.
JASPERSPRITE: I guess i loved her too in time but never as much as rose it just wasnt the same.
JASPERSPRITE: I kept waiting to see rose again but never did and finally i lost hope that i would and then i died.
JASPERSPRITE: But then i became alive again and i got to see her and i was so happy! Purr purr purr purr purr.
JASPERSPRITE: Thats my story and thats why i think theres always hope even if you die.
JASPERSPRITE: Yes maybe. :3
JASPERSPRITE: Purrrrr.
JASPERSPRITE: Ahem.
JASPERSPRITE: :3
