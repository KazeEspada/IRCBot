HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Your Harness... I mean Hayness. Highness I mean.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; F*DDLEST*%. Please pardon my utterly e%ecrable language, and unforgivable stammering, your Horseness.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I am a bale of nerves in your royal presence, and it has been so long. 
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; And when I am so spooked, you must know how that causes me to even more firmly identify with the majestic hoofbeast.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Oh, this? What, you don't recognize it?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Why, it is my smiling face, you s*lly, utterly superior person, you. Goggles and all. Can't you see?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; The last thing I desire is to disconcert our prodigal empress.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I just thought I would try smiling permanently and uncompromisingly, rather than resnorting to all those disgruntled e%pressions I usually trot out.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; It was on Meulin's suggestion, actually.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Oh, I guess you must not have herd. She and I have developed quite a STRONG and stable moirallegiance recently.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; E%actly. Whoof would have thought? If you a%ed me before we all died whether I would consider romantically pairing with a r*d*culous midb100d, let alone Ms. Leijon of all people, I'd probably have died regardless, due to laughter-induced asphy%iation.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; But do you know what it was that finally cleared the sweat steam-induced fog from my goggles? It was meeting our post-scratch counterparts. 
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Seeing our corresponding young Alternians, why it threatened to produce a tear-induced f100d on the inside of my goggles.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Their relationship in spite of the STRONG class disparity I found to be so moving, so pure. It made me reconsider my perspective on Meulin entirely, who horsenestly I'd hardly ever given a second thought.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; It's funny, don't you think? How our young ancestors took to a completely different social configuration, making for some rather odd pairings, both platonic and otherwise. A whole host of counterintuitive minglings, up and down the hemospectrum with no regard for class compatibility. And yet it all seems to make a strange amount of sense. Neigh, I might go as far as saying it's all oddly rather...
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; T*tillating? Or no, perhaps what I mean is some of their Alternian indiscretions feel a bit, I don't know...
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Naughty?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Oh ph**ey, that's not what I mean either. (Pardon my p*ttymouth.) Now you'll probably mistake me for some kind of r*scally deviant.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Yes, but no one was supposed to know about that!
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; That was always to be my own private, um, e%ploration. I had no intention of creating such a stirrup. 
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; It was only to be a very private, fleeting dalliance with a BUOY, but the whole thing became so quickly scandalized. 
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; And soon others were whisked into it such as you and the vengeful rust b100d, and... well, imagine my embarrassment. Trust me, the last thing I wanted was for royalty such as yourself to know I was pursuing forbidden b100d. To be caught with my hoof in the chocolate jar, so to nicker.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; And I suppose I would have clopped my hands of the matter after the big k*rfuffle, but...
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I guess I didn't e%pect to fall in love.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; It's true. I am not ashamed to say it. I fell mane over hooves. Phantom snout over phantom hind quarters. He...
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; He stole my breath away.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; My apologies, your E%cellency.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; She's taught me to get in touch with my anger. Through a moderately discernible series of enthusiastic mimes, she has made it clear that it is much healthier to crush all negative emotions beneath a stampede of positivity, and to always be cheerful and upbeat no matter what, even if projecting that facade is at times physically painful.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Um, yes. Very well.
HORUSS: (;???) &lt; Is this better?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Respectfully, your Superlative Magnificency, I do not think that would be advisable.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Of course, I will if you order me to without hesitation. But lately I've been attempting to canter down a trail of nonviolence.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I've been saddled for so long with anger and hostility, and now my focus is on solving problems in ways that do not involve confrontation or physical STRENGTH.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Technology can solve so many problems, for instance. Do you have any idea how much energy is stored in sweat which may be released through its steam?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Have you any clue as to the MIGHT of a quadrupedal automaton powered by raging currents of steam coursing through its e%quisite horizontal torso, and finally jetting through a perfect pair of metal nostrils? I could build as many as you like, my Empress.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Oh no, that's far from my only preoccupation. I have also taken some time to perfect the art of humor.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Would you like to hear a joke?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; A horse trots into a thirst shanty. His muscular shoulders slouched, his noble head hanging low.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; The dairyjerk observes that the great beast is clearly despondent, and asks:
HORUSS: 8=========D &lt; Why the long face?
HORUSS: 8=o &lt; At once, my lady.
HORUSS: 8o &lt; My formerly perky visage withdraws, while my fully erect posture shrivels at your regal disapproval.
HORUSS: (???;) &lt; I shall henceforth emote in my customary manner, as such.
HORUSS: ?(ò ? ó?)? &lt; Bring me a horse, and I am yours forever.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; You did it! You brought me a fine, young stallion!
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; What a beautiful gesture of friendship. I am so f*dging happy, you have no idea.
HORUSS: (;???) &lt; Wh**ps, so happy, I have become loose with foul language, and forgot I wasn't supposed to make that face anymore.
HORUSS:  (;¬?¬) &lt; You are of course free to be me whenever you wish, my lady.
HORUSS:  (????)? &lt; Yes, my peerless, e%alted Eminency?
HORUSS: (o?o;) &lt; Trigger sounds like a wonderful name for a hoofbeast.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; So true, friend. Your wisdom truly transcends your degenerate, mildly nauseating mutant b100d.
HORUSS: Omg yes
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Oh, hello Damara. I heard you were having a mechanical issue with your chest over here. Mind if I take a 100k?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I... think you said yes? Sorry, I really struggle with your coarse lowb100d accent.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I didn't quite understand that either. Something about milk? Served to you in a particular way?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Yes, if you would like some milk, I can bring you some later. I'll just need to equip my steam powered deSTRENGTHening gloves so that I may hand you the glass without shattering it.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I really need to finish my universal translation device so we can have a more coherent conversation. It's just so difficult to get the circuitry to function correctly when one insists on relying on steam power.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; You want me to bring your what to what e%actly with my what?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Hmm. I...
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Sure?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Do what with your schoolgirl uniform?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I wouldn't want to do anything to ruin it. It's quite nice. 
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; But perhaps I could craft a robotic avatar for you, emulating your fashion choices. Actually, if I did that, I could install more sensible speech algorithms, so that I could understand you for a change.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Um. *Cough.*
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Damara, forgive me if I'm leaping to conclusions, but has the nature of your cryptic remarks been leaning... well...
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; A little b100?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Come again?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I suppose Rufioh should ask. He's always been the only one who can parse your vulgar, peasant tongue.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Yes, I really enjoy making this face. It really helps remind me through persistent facial discomfort that appearing to be happy should always be one's top priority.
HORUSS: 8=O &lt; Why? You don't find it displeasing, do you?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Really, I could stop making the face. Meenah recently ordered me to stop making it in her presence, and I of course instantly complied. I would just as readily do the same for someone as important to me as you.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Rufioh, your affable malleability continues to be your finest quality. It is the jewel in your mohawk. A true diamond in the Ruf. You always were the ideal embodiment of your aspect, as pleasantly wayward and fickle as The Breeze itself.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Of course. We always strive to hone our craft, ever pounding at the iron to make the shoe a perfect shape. I know well how much work it takes.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; My path was similarly governed by my aspect. For the longest time, I felt as if I was a blank sheet of paper. Like I had to make myself out of nothing.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; And so I began to listen closely to the void within myself and corral the various personal attributes I herd calling to me. 
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Much like assembling a comple% machine, I began to piece together a STRONG identity, which of course included discovering a passion for mechani% itself.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; And needless to say, what also galloped out of the void in my soul was the realization that I am obviously a noble hoofbeast, though my physical appearance cruelly betrays this fact.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; And in following sweeps I would keep turning my mechanically augmented, acute equine ear back to the abyss within, and continue to discover more about myself. I would learn that I was more complicated than I ever imagined. More complicated than any mortal mind could understand a person to be.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Knowing myself to be hoofbeastkin was only grazing the surface of the pasture. Merely skimming the cream from the top of the milk. I was so much more.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; It turns out my body was merely the host to a highly intricate system of entities of any sort you could name, biological or mechanical, sentient or nonsentient, physical or metaphysical. My inner field of e%perience is shared by the souls of ancient legendary musclebeasts, a range of devices such as hivehold appliances, a number of cosmological features such as planets, star systems, even several universes, and a variety of abstract concepts which sentient beings have not yet formed the language to e%press.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; But as much as I learned about myself, I could never find a way to become whole.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; The void was never filled until you came along, Rufioh. 
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; If there is any lesson I would like people to take from my story, it is a lesson that is a multiple system consisting of two distinct lessons.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; The first is how love heals all wounds, even ones consisting of the infinite essence of void permeating your entire e%istence and role as a legendary hero.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; The second is how if you are faced with any crisis of identity whatsoever, it's really important to do your best to manufacture esoteric features of your personality and believe in them very STRONGLY and tell people about those things as frequently as possible.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I can assure you right now, the labor involved in smithing my personality into one that is interesting and complicated was rather intensive.
HORUSS: 8=D~~ &lt; I really worked up a good sweat in the process.
HORUSS: 8=D~~~~ &lt; (That is the sweat dripping from my face.)
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Anyway, I apologize for talking so much. You know how you have a way of drawing the breath out of people.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; What were you trying to tell me?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Oh! I'm sorry, what did you say?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; My ear valves filled up with sweat, and I didn't catch most of that.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Hey, why don't we participate in an enjoyable activity together later, as romantic afterlife partners? We could play one of those foreign card games you seem to like. What's that one called again? Fiddlespoon?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I know I'm not the best partner to share your e%otic and somewhat childish interests with, but I do my best to try to understand them and enjoy them with you. The most important thing is that we spend time together, and maintain a STRONG relationship.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; E%cuse me?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Oh! I see you've taken an interest in this fine, albeit diminutive steed given to me as a gift earlier.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Isn't it wonderful? I shall feed it many an apple and it will grow to be STRONG.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I don't... do what with your horns? Ride what, now?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; You want me to... something about... hay? Hm.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; You would like me to perform... what rhythmic behavior, e%actly? While making which animal noise?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Do what with... wait... all of you? Wouldn't that be quite a lot of Damaras, regardless of the activity you are trying to describe?
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Trying to decode your speech is quite agitating, you know.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Whenever I talk to you, my system gets a little switchy.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; I begin to faintly channel an ancient soul from Alterniasia, and I come very close to understanding you. But then it vanishes just as quickly, and my host vessel is left with nothing but an overwhelming e%perience of perspiration.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Not that I would e%pect a lowly rust b100ded singleton like you to understand.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; Your Harness... I mean Hayness. Highness I mean.
HORUSS: 8=D &lt; F*DDLEST*%. Please pardon my utterly e%ecrable language, and unforgivable stammering, your Horseness.
