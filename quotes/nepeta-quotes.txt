AC: :33 &lt; *ac saunters from her dark cave a little bit sl33py from the recent kill*
AC: :33 &lt; *ac uses one of her mouths to lick the fresh blood off her paws*
AC: :33 &lt; *and the other one to blow you a kiss!*
AC: :33 &lt; *yes! ac finds that to be a most admirable use of a kiss!*
AC: :33 &lt; *she thinks that goblin wishes n33d to come true too just like any other kind of purrsons wishes*
AC: :33 &lt; *ac begs your pardon while she rips apart this tasty beast to prepare a meal for her cubs*
AC: :33 &lt; uh oh!
AC: :33 &lt; dont you dare!
AC: :33 &lt; i mean
AC: :33 &lt; *ac shouts dont you dare!*
AC: :33 &lt; *indignantly*
AC: :33 &lt; *ac says noooooooo and looks a bit crestfallen*
AC: :33 &lt; *ac gets a clever idea to slake the majestic dragons mighty hunger*
AC: :33 &lt; *she prepares the lions share of the slain armored cholerbear for gc*
AC: :33 &lt; *ac pawses a moment and nods knowingly with a couple of smug grins on her face*
AC: :33 &lt; *she confirms it is ind33d the bulliest of bears!*
AC: :33 &lt; *but as it happens the really cute cub lands in a bush safe and sound, whew!*
AC: :33 &lt; *ac crinkles up her nose and prepares for a really unprecedented marathon of baffling feline obstinacy*
AC: :33 &lt; *her dragonyyydy suitor will make neither rhyme nor reason of her purrplexing behavior for even an instant!*
AC: :33 &lt; oh! h33h33
AC: :33 &lt; ok if you mean a computer game then yes that sounds like fun

AC: :33 &lt; oh
AC: :33 &lt; well it does sound like it will be a lot of fun but i think i should get purrmission first
AC: :33 &lt; i know!
AC: :33 &lt; but still im kind of scared of him and i think purrhaps its best to just run it by him first so there isnt a kerfuffle about it or anything
AC: :33 &lt; i knooow
AC: :33 &lt; but i dont think itll be a big deal
AC: :33 &lt; ill just mention it casually and itll be fine im sure and then we can play in just a little bit!
AC: :33 &lt; k!
AC: :33 &lt; *ac perks up curiously*
AC: :33 &lt; *she wiggles her rear end a bit and
AC: :33 &lt; *ac perks up curiously*
AC: :33 &lt; *she wiggles her rear end a bit and then chases something she s33s bounce into one of karkats shoes*
AC: :33 &lt; i am???
AC: :33 &lt; i mean *ac says i am??? wondrously*
AC: :33 &lt; *ac gathers up all the brick pieces and builds a cute little house and invites karkat inside*

AC: :33 &lt; its not that big of a deal!
AC: :33 &lt; hes not so bad!
AC: :33 &lt; *ac twitches her friendly whiskers at ct*
AC: :33 &lt; *ct purrplexes over where he put that important wrench that he n33ded for building a fancy robot or something*
AC: :33 &lt; *he says, now where did that silly old wrench go??*
AC: :33 &lt; *but oh look! ct p33ks around the corner to find that a very playful kitty has stolen the robot wrench and is now kicking it vigorously with her hind legs!*

NEPETA: :33 &lt; *the distinguished pouncellor nods in the most dignified and legal of manners at the dashing and well dressed legislacerator*
NEPETA: :33 &lt; *she double checks a series of impurrtant legal clawses and rubber stamps them with wild abandon for the most judicial sort of approval pawsible*

NEPETA: :33 &lt; *nepeta sh33pishly looks at her shoe with a question on her purrsed lips*
NEPETA: :33 &lt; but so many of our friends have died, and it just makes me so sad to think about!
NEPETA: :33 &lt; i dont think we have even scratched the surface of our f33lings yet, and our f33lings in this case are a very tall and inviting carpeted post to sink our claws into!
NEPETA: :33 &lt; i KNOW, i was speaking metafurrikitty :33
NEPETA: :33 &lt; besides, i know for a FACT that you are still f33ling b100 (h33h33) from losing aradia
NEPETA: :33 &lt; i did not mention, but i think i should...
NEPETA: :33 &lt; it may purrk you up to know that i had a dream about her during my last catnap!
NEPETA: :33 &lt; yes, she had these purrty wings and a splendid hood, i think she might have b33n cosplaying much like friska has b33n!
NEPETA: :33 &lt; she was so happy, just like she used to be, and she said she would s33 you soon!
NEPETA: :33 &lt; equius?

NEPETA: :33 &lt; D --> *STRONG EQUIUS NO LIKE HISS-POOR ATTEMPT AT ROLEPLAY, ALSO DISAPPROVES OF MISSED OPPURRTUNITY TO SPELL AMUSEMENT AS AMEWSMENT*
NEPETA: :33 &lt; D --> *EQUIUS COMMAND STRONG MEOWSCULAR CAT GIRL TO GET INTO ROLE BETTER* B33

NEPETA: :33 &lt; equius, dammit! why do you always have to make this so cerebral!
NEPETA: :33 &lt; sorry :((
NEPETA: :33 &lt; well you dont always have to announce who you are purrtending to be in every line! and you dont always have to point out that its just purrtend!
NEPETA: :33 &lt; in fact, that is sort of an RPing no no
NEPETA: :33 &lt; oh i dunno, just by having fun and having a sense of humor about it and such! and not sneaking in sneaky sneakret little barbs of disdain for the exercise, i am not dumb you know, i catch those like scared little scurrying rodents!
NEPETA: :33 &lt; yes yes, ok youre right. that was really great!
NEPETA: :33 &lt; do more of that. ok ready? go!
NEPETA: :33 &lt; errrrrrg! fiiiine, we can stop
NEPETA: :33 &lt; here, take your gross stinky glasses back, SWEATQUIUS
NEPETA: :33 &lt; umm
NEPETA: :33 &lt; yeah
NEPETA: :33 &lt; why dont
NEPETA: :33 &lt; you hang on to that
NEPETA: :33 &lt; forever!
NEPETA: :33 &lt; it is my purrsent to you
NEPETA: :33 &lt; dont mention it! &lt;33
AC: :33 &lt; jaspers i guess i should say furwell to you now :((
AC: :33 &lt; beclaws this is the end of your timeline and i dont know what catpuns to you after this
AC: :33 &lt; i mean happens to you after this, heheh, that one was kind of obtuse, sorry
AC: :33 &lt; hmmmmmm thats a hard question
AC: :33 &lt; ok imagine a long tempting strand of yarn
AC: :33 &lt; now imagine instead of being made of wiggly enticing stuff, its made of what lets you exist
AC: :33 &lt; and you are right at the twitching tip of it, dont you s33? look at the sky!
AC: :33 &lt; thats fine, you dont have to try too hard
AC: :33 &lt; all you have to know is its the scratch and im not a hundred purrcent sure what happens next fur you
AC: :33 &lt; h33h33h33 :DD
AC: :33 &lt; well you know roses friend john?
AC: :33 &lt; imagine that he is using this great big circle like a really fun scratching post, and it makes all this light come out that changes everything
AC: :33 &lt; just after he starts doing that the sky goes funny everywhere and then i cant s33 you anymore
AC: :33 &lt; thats what it is
AC: :33 &lt; im a bit nervous for you, especially since you remind me so much of someone i already lost
AC: :33 &lt; but maybe youll be ok? i dont know
AC: :33 &lt; you are a brave kitty, just like pounce was &lt;33
AC: :33 &lt; yes! she was amazing, i bet you and she would have gotten along famousely
AC: :33 &lt; yes she smelled really good, and also, she was SUPER beautyifful.
AC: :33 &lt; did you ever have someone nice back on earth who you loved?
AC: :33 &lt; h33h33, of course you did. i mean a nice cat who was your matesprit?
AC: :33 &lt; thats too bad
AC: :33 &lt; but i bet lots of girl cats would have loved to be with you, if only there had b33n some around to hear your lovely meows :33
AC: :33 &lt; me?
AC: :33 &lt; well
AC: :33 &lt; i have never told anybody this not even my moirail
AC: :33 &lt; heh, actually hes the LAST guy i might tell, he so wouldnt appurrve X33
AC: :33 &lt; but yes i have liked somebody for quite some time, but alas he doesnt know it
AC: :33 &lt; hmmmmm
AC: :33 &lt; ohhh no no no, im too shy even for that!
AC: :33 &lt; and he is so adorably grumpy all the time, it probably wouldnt go over well
AC: :33 &lt; its hard to explain, maybe cats think diffurntly, but trolls tend to be pretty cautious about expressing their f33lings when it comes to the flushed quadrant
AC: :33 &lt; it is
AC: :33 &lt; ummmmmmmm
AC: :33 &lt; okay it has romantic applications but it is also something more general than that
AC: :33 &lt; a quadrant is
AC: :33 &lt; how do i say this!
AC: :33 &lt; a quadrant is a thing in a group of things that consists of four similar things
AC: :33 &lt; EXACTLY like paws!!! :DD
AC: :33 &lt; i know, but its just not that simple. i could make someone else jealous i think, and what if he doesnt f33l the same way, and, urrgh, its so complickated
AC: :33 &lt; maybe i just n33d to let go of the silly infatuation
AC: :33 &lt; i think its never going to happen honestly
AC: :33 &lt; oh?
AC: :33 &lt; so, youre saying that maybe i will have to die to get to be with him?
AC: :33 &lt; i hope thats not the case!
AC: :33 &lt; but i guess you just have a different way of looking at things
AC: :33 &lt; thank you for the advice jaspers!
