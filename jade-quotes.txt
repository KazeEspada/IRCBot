<3
hi happy birthday rose!!! <3

yep!
i finally finished a present for him
ive been working on it for years!!!!
heheheh.... :)
i just mailed it too so it is sure to get there on time
mail takes a while to get anywhere from here!!!
i dont think you really mean that!

it is a tip!!!!
did you have a pet a long time ago that died?
ok well how did you feel about your cat, did you love him a lot?
ummmmm ok....
thats fine!!!
it doesnt really matter i think, just.....
what if someone told you you could play a game that would bring him back to life?
yes that someone is me!!!!!!!!
i just thought you might find it interesting
oh i dont know
im just saying is all
i think youll hear about it later and maybe you can talk to john and dave about it
they are way more into all that stuff than i am!!!!
hey!!!!
how is your adventure going john?
thats good!!
hmm well i think whatever it is it must be pretty important!
dont lose hope john i think it will all turn out for the best if you stay positive....
just keep listening to your grandmothers advice!!!
oh uhhh.......

yeah maybe that was it!!
heheheh :D
oh well john
i want to explain lots of things to you....
some things that i know
im just......
waiting!
oh! john!!!
i forgot i was messaging you about that meteor that fell near my house!
oh boy.... well........
it turns out i was confused about it...
really confused! o_o;
see i guess i fell asleep for a while and.....
lost track of time
that happens!!
well.....
its hard to explain!!!
but...
i know what it is now!
and now i know everythings going to be ok!!!
oh gosh john i really want to tell you all this stuff!!!
but i cant yet
i really think you need to wake up first!
well ok not literally
well ok maybe KINDA literally!!
lol :)
anyway time for you to go john
i think you have some company!!!
<3 
A silly girl naps by her flowers.
It is quite likely that she tired herself out with a variety of silly antics, as silly girls are often known to do.
She may have a silly name too.
Or maybe not. It is hard to say for sure without asking her.
But since she's slumbering peacefully, it would be a shame to wake her up.
You might as well just give her a name right now.
Uh... I guess... I guess her name is Farmstink.
You try to roust Farmstink from her slumber, but she is really down for the count!
It looks like she is holding some sort of NOTE.
Anyway, that would be a really terrible thing to do to poor, sweet Farmstink.
Your name is JADE. You have just woken from a restful nap, and as usual, you have no recollection of having fallen asleep.
You have quite a number of INTERESTS. So many in fact, you have trouble keeping track of them all, even with an assortment of COLORFUL REMINDERS on your fingers to help you sort out everything on your mind.
Nevertheless, when you spend time in your GARDEN ATRIUM, the only thing on your mind is your deep passion for HORTICULTURE.

and we wont talk again for a pretty long time
not until you enter!
yeah!
lol what did you want to know?
there sure are a lot of challenges but yes i am sure!!
dave is cool, you know he will come around when the time is right
he just has a lot of work to do first
and so do you!
youll need to keep searching for a stable signal and power source, it will be hard but dont give up!!!
and dont worry about me either, focus on playing with john first
it all starts with you two!
haha dark? thats ridiculous!
i dont really know what to tell you other than its not going to be what you think it is
and most importantly you will have your questions answered, but they will be the ones you havent thought to ask yet!
just be patient and be brave youll see
it will be fun!!!!!!
uh oh looks like youve got to go
take care rose! <3<3<3 
oh nooooooo
>:O
you can leave me alone!!!!!
how can you even be talking to me after i blocked you....
AND after i logged out????
i get that youre a jerk and you should shut up!
goodbye you jerk!!!!!!!!! 
yay thank you john!!!!! :D
heheh i know but it is nice of you to think of us all like that!
im sure it is great, i cant wait either!!!!!
it might take a while to get here from there but it will be worth the wait!
john thats ok really! im sure will get to me exactly when it needs to and it will be a nice surprise when it does!
<3......
uhhhh hold on
ok im back sorry
i had to tell someone to go away!
yup :o
ive never had any sort of feeling about them or what they want which is kind of weird!!!
but it seems to me like they are probably all different people and not one guy
i have counted twelve
some people just like to needle others for some reason john
it is like a game i guess. they are like pranksters!!
but i think they are mostly harmless
every so often they manage to get through my block filter and hassle me. its been going on for years! actually some of them are kind of funny i think hehe

oh!!!! 
that reminds me since im setting the game up with dave to be his server you are going to need to do the same thing for me 
can you see from where youre standing the place your dads car would have fallen? 
you should go there and get your copy of the server and set up with me..... 
oh and also get your package!!!!!! :) 
johhhhn will you stop trying to trap me!!! 
you TOLD me the car fell remember? 
jeeeez 
JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ!!!!! 
john im not any more psychic than you though 
hahahaha oops ok! 
i mean i know lots of things but im really serious its no more information than what you have access to 
but you dont know it yet 
anyway we can talk more about it soon..... 
i wont have to be so coy with you anymore because im pretty sure most of the stuff that was supposed to happen has already happened 
i couldnt tell you about it because it would have messed it up! 
just give me a few minutes while i set up this game! 
and say hi to the salamanders for me 
<3
yo yooooooo!!!!!!! 
so youre finally playing the game with rose? 
shes probably just exploring im sure she will come around soon.... 
but its great that you got her out of there in time!!! 
so how does it feel to be a BIG TIME HERO 
mister braveybrave mcheropants 
hehehe 
but it turns out to be CRAZY what kind of basket ball this man plays! 
ummmm...... 
the HOOP IS ON FIRE... 
ok i forget how it goes

so now it is my turn to be the star! 
i will be your hero 
its me 
i installed the game! 
im connecting to you as the server player 
dont worry! 
you can keep playing with rose while i just set up a few things 
i figured id get a good head start to avoid all the drama you guys are always getting into 
such a bunch of drama queens!!! 
(DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA) 
yes! 
itll come when it comes regardless of what we do 
the timer really just lets you know when its coming

i was tired! 
well you are out of luck..... 
i will wake up when im good and ready!

ummmmmm.... 
the right side... 
why?? 
okaaay...... 
...
duuurrrrr dave i was going to build some stairs up there durrrrrhhhhhh 
gosh i dont know i guess i didnt find the time to make them because i keep getting punched in the face by robots and stuff!!!!!!! 
;p 
i dont know! 
nope.... 
what was it doing up here? 
i think your sprite wants to hatch it! 
awww 
hmm... 
i dont know it looks like its pretty warm where you are 
maybe not too long then???? 
i guess we'll find out! 
:(
ok some of these things we can deploy but some things we dont have nearly enough grist for! 
no no weve got enough for that..... 
but its still pretty expensive 
yeah me too! 
and we have 2000 to work with 
ok 1998 ._. 
ohhh... 
how much did rose start with? when she was playing with john? 
k 
i guess we keep getting more with each server/client connection! 
no!!!! 
i cant buy the holopad thingy and the intellibeam laserstation 
hahahaha no theyre right here! 
they cost a fortune 
yeah ive got that too! 
i will deploy it 
yes i think that is how it works 
when john connects with me he will probably get some cool new things too!
yay thank you john!!!!! :D 
heheh i know but it is nice of you to think of us all like that! 
im sure it is great, i cant wait either!!!!! 
it might take a while to get here from there but it will be worth the wait! 
john thats ok really! im sure will get to me exactly when it needs to and it will be a nice surprise when it does! 
<3...... 
uhhhh hold on
what do you want????? 
this is nonsense 
every time i believe something you say you laugh at me and call me a gullible human!!!! 
its so childish 
D: 
i dont know what youre talking about at all..... 
its another prank 
no 
you mean the robot you think is stupid? 
the one youve mocked me for having on a number of occasions??? 
this is the worst prank youve ever pulled!!!!!! 
why should i do that?
ok im back sorry 
i had to tell someone to go away! 
yup :o 
ive never had any sort of feeling about them or what they want which is kind of weird!!! 
but it seems to me like they are probably all different people and not one guy 
i have counted twelve 
some people just like to needle others for some reason john 
it is like a game i guess. they are like pranksters!! 
but i think they are mostly harmless 
every so often they manage to get through my block filter and hassle me. its been going on for years! actually some of them are kind of funny i think hehe
dave here punch this code! 
L229BxoG 
and then put it in the jumper shunty thing and see what it does
well i think this is only one way to consolidate all the gizmo features.... 
hang on ill give you more codes!!!
hehehe...... 
yeah i bet hes right! 
wow no i dont think so... 
hes being a bit more literal than that! 
what did he say? 
:) 
well what he meant was..... 
that you have a dream self 
who is supposed to wake up whenever your real self goes to sleep 
we all do! all four of us i mean 
but see your dream self still stays asleep when you go to sleep 
because you havent woken up yet! 
yes 
no you would not be out of line! 
in fact im asleep now 
:p 
no only i can do that! 
because of my robot 
you guys can probably make your own i guess...... 
but you need to wake up first for it to matter and maybe by the time that happens you might not even need them!!! 
um....... 
ok well i dont really know how to answer the second part but yeah shes dreaming! 
shes most likely lying in your bed troubled and restless 
about things burdening her 
which is to say you!!!!! 
things about who you really are and what your purpose is 
but you cant start figuring those things out yet because youre not awake because youre not ready yet 
thats why you have such terrible dreams all the time rose! 
im sure it would help to start piecing together the clues to nudge your subconscious 
or maybe face some things you havent faced yet? 
i dunno! its for you to find out 
maybe the stuff you wrote on your walls can give you a clue? 
the.... 
er 
didnt dave tell you? 
._. 
he said he was going to tell you <_<;
yeah hes pretty tied up right now! 
noooooooooooooooooooo
he made me promise not to bug him while im asleep! 
but he will find a way to be clever and make me punch myself in the face again :(
ummmmmm..... 
oh! yes it appears so!!! 
i guess! ive been pretty busy here 
ive had to stay asleep for a long time because john is supposed to wake up soon 
but he just wont wake up!!!!! 
im pretty sure im supposed to be the one to wake him but i dont know what to do :( 
huh?? 
oh...... 
well thanks for trying anyway! 
i hope so! 
what am i doing when i wake up? 
oh no!!!!! 
yes i know what you mean.... 
that sounds like it would be fun! 
but you guys never even played pranks on me, you were always just kinda mean D: 
well i know i havent trolled you guys! 
or not yet......... 
heheheh 
oh yeah! 
i totally forgot about that 
does it really blow up or was that another trick? 
hmmmmm 
you could ask me in the future! 
is he not a nice guy? 
hmmm.... 
well maybe hes just been through some tough times 
maybe we should give him the benefit of the doubt? 
for whatever its worth i think youre a pretty nice guy too! 
also you seem to be the only one who ever thinks to talk to me while im asleep! 
why is that? 
oh no!!! 
dream selves can die? 
i never knew that 
or even thought about it.... 
i guess it makes sense though
You suddenly understand jack shit. 
Where are you? What just happened? 
Oh great, now someone's bothering you. Boy are you not in the mood for getting trolled now.
what!!!!! 
see what! 
go away 
bluhhh what are you talking about.... 
my head hurts 
just stop it, stop trolling me 
i hate you all!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
about what! 
i dont remember talking to you at all 
my dream was horrible!!! 
i dont know what that was, i have never dreamed anything like it 
oh god.... 
prospit :( 
is it really gone? 
uuuuuuuuugh D: 
oh...... 
that was you? 
argh 
sorry but 
could you please 
not use all those stupid parentheses?????? 
i can hardly read what you type and its giving me a migraine 
what about the -E thing, can you stop that too? it is also annoying and stupid 
meh :\ 
hehehe 
ok, sorry for sounding bossy 
you seem pretty nice, and you sure do look exotic 
i kind of always thought you were all like 
a bunch of really obnoxious humans 
hey feferi, i would like to remember...... 
but everything is so foggy right now 
i remember prospit being attacked 
and 
falling..... 
aaaand 
i dunno :( 
do you know what happened? 
fffffff 
yeah, i gathered that! XC 
ohhhhhhh!!!!! 
i do remember you! 
i remember you were talking to me about my lusus, and i had no idea what you were talking about 
and still sort of dont :\ 
but you must mean bec 
also it was shortly before your friend sent me a weird message 
about how my robot was going to explode, and i should talk to him when it happens 
this was months ago 
it was the most awful and angry one 
i am so sick of him, i really dont want to talk to that pathetic jerk ever 
thats his name? 
hmmmm 
thats right, it was about some kind of plan... 
which he said me from the future told him about? 
i thought it was total nonsense at the time 
but 
i guess he was telling the truth 
so maybe i should talk to him? i dont know 
ewwwww 
ewwwwwwwwwwww! 
fish aliens are weird 
ok feferi, it was nice talking to you 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
i am never going to sleep again! 
never never never never never never 
yes, im so tired 
:( 
well, ok 
bye
ok, my robot exploded 
now what smart guy! 
i knew i would regret this 
talking to you is so terrible 
its making my headache worse 
uuuugh shut uuuuup! 
will you just tell me what you wanted? 
i cant believe i fell for this 
it was just a setup to troll me some more 
why do you go to such lengths to troll me? i just dont understand it 
thats ridiculous, humanning isnt a word 
and if it was, it would be a nicer thing to do than trolling! 
you know what i mean, stop pretending you dont 
aaaaaaa that is something a troll would say! 
i mean you are being patronizing and disingenuous to get a rise out of me 
and that is really really shitty!!!!!! 
i am so tired of it, and i am done talking to you forever 
bye karkat, it was awful knowing you! 
yes 
as if my day needed another reason to get worse 
what does that mean! 
is this another prank 
you are seriously the worst at pranks 
:|
oh jeez, why am i doing this 
this is so stupid! 
bluhhh youre so funny!!!!! 
are you enjoying yourself karkat? 
well obviously i know some things youve said are true 
its just hard to take everything at face value when youre always so nasty! 
ok i understand that you are another group of players and you are in some sort of trouble 
but maybe if you had been nice to me instead of terrorizing me all those years i would have believed you 
and we could have worked together to solve your problems as well as ours 
it just makes me sad to think thats probably impossible now because you are so angry and stubborn! 
uh huh 
sure karkat, whatever you say! 
i cant take this anymore!!!!!!!! 
i dont even know what im reading here but its preposterous and ive had it! 
i am just so angry, i cant believe i let you push me around all those years 
you are completely out of your mind, i was too nice by just blocking you and typing frowny faces and stuff 
i should have let you HAVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
SHUT UP!!!!!!! 
future karkat, if you really are future karkat...... 
where do you get off thinking you can just suddenly act like were pals because you said you apologized???? 
if you want to apologize then great i am all ears! but just mentioning it off hand and then yelling at yourself the same way you yell at me all the time as if i need a knight to come save me from yourself is so lame, not to mention completely insane 
i cant even believe the things im typing here! this is so stupid, talking to two of you at once is the worst thing imaginable 
you treat everyone horribly, even yourself, i cant even fathom how awful it is to be you 
past karkat, youre acting like a bigger jerk than he is and i think you know that! why dont you take his advice and grow up 
as if theres even a real difference between you two. three hours is hardly any time at all, you are the same person YOU FUCKING IDIOTS!!!!!!!!! 
stop it!!!! 
ugh, i dont know whats worse, jerk karkat or goofy sycophant karkat 
i cant stand it, whether youre trying to be nice or just being a crazy asshole, you are just so weird!!! 
im through humoring you, i dont even care about this stupid exploded robot mission, whatever that was 
hahaha, FAT CHANCE!!!! 
dave wait dont go! 
youve got to save me from this insanity :( 
i cant wait for future you to future kiss my ass! 
i also cant wait for past you to past drop dead and go to hell, PAST TENSE!!!!!!!! 
when are those things going to happen?? or will have already past/future happened????? 
i want to put another reminder on my finger so i know when its time to throw a party!!!! 
jesus will you just ban me already???? 
my head hurts so bad now i think im going to cry 
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa XO 
i will just ban myself!!!! 
*JADE HARLEY BANNED HERSELF FROM RESPONDING TO THE GRUMPY SHIT HEAD MISERY ZONE, AND IS NEVER COMING BACK* 
pchoooooooooooooooo 
That was not a conversation you were hoping to wake up to. You feel more agitated and disoriented than ever. 
You consult your reminders to get your bearings on what to do next. 
But you can't remember what they mean at all. You have a feeling these are all useless now.
You ditch the strings. All but one. 
You don't remember what it was for, but it reminds you of something nonetheless. Something you can't believe you forgot about...
john are you there??? 
yes! 
im so relieved to talk to you and hear youre ok 
i mean....... 
are you ok john? your dream self i mean 
:( 
yes, but that was not prospit. that was its moon which was severed by the crazy derse agent 
i dunno! 
really?? :D 
<3 
i dont know! i did not give him one after applying the upgrades 
i gave her a girls name when i was very young, but now she is a different bunny, and also a boy i guess? 
its up to you john, he is your bunny 
hahahaha 
again? 
you were at roses house?? 
what!!!! 
ugh he is so weird 
you shouldnt listen to him! 
D: 
he is angry and a huge pain in the ass 
have you ever talked to two of him at once???? 
dont ever do it! you will get a headache 
noooooooo, think again 
???? 
:| 
you mean from armageddon? 
john that is so stupid 
but also kind of cute i guess 
ok then the bunny will be named after your silly movie star fantasy crush 
yeah...... 
that reminds me john 
have you looked in the lab yet? 
the big room in the sphere at the top of the tower 
could you do me a favor and not look in there? 
its nothing that secret or personal or anything.... 
it is just something kind of sad and weird for you to see 
it is my dead dream self 
it has been there for years, i always knew i would die but i did not realize it would go like this.... 
what? 
oh no!!!!! 
im sorry john :( 
i understand 
ummmmmmm 
i think i would rather not talk about that either 
you did???? 
oh nooooooo 
john that ring is really important, it belongs to the white queen! 
when you go to sleep again, you should try to find it and keep it safe! 
yes i have seen it, it is so huge ._. 
how much time do you suppose we have?
hmmmm i wonder what the significance of that number is 
but they usually do! 
yes, youre right 
i dont know... 
there are so many possibilities 
hmmmmmm! 
yes, it sure seems that way 
well 
maybe you will get that chance john 
yes, as a matter of fact i am sure we will both get that chance! 
i once dreamt that we would 
sure, why not! 
that is what i believe this game is for in part 
you got to bring back your nanna, rose brought back her cat, i can bring back grandpa, and dave... 
dave got to bring back a dead bird because of course he is too cool to have any dead family members 
wait, he did???? 
that is 
soooo cooooool :O 
i almost completely forgot i was his server player!!!!! 
i hope hes not in trouble, i should check on him 
we probably have so much to catch up on 
i dont see him in his house either :( 
oh, ok... 
jeez, i feel so out of the loop :( 
yes! ok here i go 
what! 
augh, nooooooooooooooo 
oh god, dont get me started :| 
he was a strange and silly man 
hmmmmmmm, perhaps 
is that allowed? 
yes, thats a good idea
it is some sort of terrible creature my grandpa hunted 
he called it the typheus minion 
i always hated it! 
i guess so 
it is probably a coincidence though 
yeah maybe..... 
i guess it would make sense for someone to name a really awful web browser after such a hideous monster 
well sorry, i just found it sort of a weird and creepy thing to grow up with! 
:p!!!!!! 
joooohhhhhn, it is so crappy 
YEAH RIGHT 
now is obviously not the best time to have the argument about whose browser is better.... 
but really john you should upgrade to echidna, its so much nicer 
after you upgrade your clunky old computer of course :P 
maybe when i am in the game, i can give you one of mine! 
oh??? 
:O 
omg 
john that is incredible 
i cant wait to make stuff like that!!!!!! 
except... 
all my awesome stuff exploded with my room :( 
yay!!!
what is the problem!!!! 
yes 
nice! 
how much time? 
D: 
john, try to be more careful! 
um..... 
what?
oh............. 
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 
but youre a troll 
and thats what trolls do! 
even when they say they wont 
sometimes especially!!!!!! 
ok..... 
even though i still have no idea what youre talking about 
whats a lusus!!!!! 
:\ 
ok feferi. what is it? 
i dont understand 
whats a dream bubble? 
ugh 
feferi i thought you said you were going to stop using your typing quirk! 
i dont know... im sure i remember you said that 
oh 
yeah it is 
i dont know what i was thinking.... 
i just had a major case of deja vu! 
i felt like we already had this conversation 
actually 
it still sort of feels that way 
its not going away :o
ummm 
what do you mean i never explained it to you? 
if this really is the first time we talked, why would i have? 
XO 
feferi that one was a stretch even by your fish punnery standards 
aaah why do i know that you like to make fish puns??? 
actually 
i do remember this conversation 
it was in the past! 
but if it was in the past, then where am i now? 
so what is going on? 
i dont think i am asleep.... 
i am not on prospit 
oh... 
vaguely 
so this is a dream? 
sorry 
i think 
i am in the game now, right? 
um 
why are you here! 
are you asleep too? 
oh yeah 
i do remember that 
then why are you here now?
You don't see anything. 
Someone out there is messing with you. Good thing grandpa taught you never to leave home without your rifle, even by accident.
thanks bec, good boy! 
soooooo... 
can you talk now? 
what do you have to say? 
what happened in here? 
where is everything? all the globes and houseguests... 
and the cruxtruder??? 
and grandpa??????????? 
bec, what did you do! 
has someone been a bad dog?? 
wait never mind, please dont answer that!!!! 
@_@ 
hey!!!!! 
last time i talked to you i was asking for help and you were just nakking at me 
what was up with that bro??? 
you did? 
ohhhhhhh 
yes, i did get around during that battle didnt i? 
it was really intense!!! 
those stupid things are impossible to kill :( 
in the heat of the fray i didnt notice you! 
where were you? 
yeah im fine, thanks for asking! 
what do you mean you remember seeing me? 
was i jumping through time or something? 
youre from the future? 
:p 
john told me you have been doing some time traveling 
that is..... 
really really awesome! 
i knoooooow 
it is a really neat place but its freeeeezing :o 
wait! 
dave!! 
uuugh stupid lousy cool dudes 
an hour? 
:O 
i can not believe how cool that is 
this is me believing neither that, nor its coolness :O 
hmmmm... 
i dont know if i get that but ok! 
i will? 
ok........ 
but anyway youre right, its coooold!!!!!! 
i have to go back inside 
i wish i had winter clothes 
and if i did, i ALSO wish that my wardrobifier didnt blow up with all of my beautiful clothes inside it :C 
im so horribly unprepared for this.... i have never even seen snow before, can you believe that!!! 
derp yes dave that is so where i lived 
that is as biographically accurate as it gets about me! 
no??? 
isnt it great????? 
lava is NOT better than snow :| 
you cant play in lava, its no fun 
you can only die in lava 
eww dave no 
no this is so lame 
i am hearing an insane and stupid guy say stupid idiot things while wearing dumb sunglasses for lame morons! 
heheheh 
why dont we play in the snow later 
as soon as you get some.................................... 
.............................. 
................... 
.......... 
............... 
....... 
.... 
... 
.. 
. 
time 8) 
i know youre joking around, you are not too cool at all, you dont even think that 
brrrrrr 
i forgot :\ 
i cant!!! 
all that stuff blew up 
its a long story that involves a pinata and a gun and a very naughty doggie 
so anyway, that reminds me ive got to talk to john! 
ive got to get him to make me some new gizmos... 
assuming thats even possible
john has magic cyclone powers? 
whoa.... 
you guys are all so much better than me, i feel sooooo lame
heehee 
maaaybe 
:) 
oh no 
did he lose it in a magic cyclone? 
we do? 
doing what?? 
yes 
oh jeez, a few hours???? 
fastest hours :o 
but that costs so much grist!!! 
omg...
what does this thing do? 
on the back of cards? 
but 
we can already read those! 
hmm 
but isnt the whole point of captchas that only humans can read them? 
and not robots??? 
anti spam? 
yeah obviously! 
oh nooo 
whats the good news? 
dave i still dont know what youre actually doing here
oh.... 
to give it to john? 
but... 
you are already roses server player! 
and john is mine! 
not to mention im yours!!! 
can you really be a server player to your own server player? 
but i guess 
i thought that john sort of..... 
HAD to be my server? you know?
well youre from the future right? 
dont you know already if itll work?
pretty smooth dave
shades for everybody 
8) 8)
so you will be the server for BOTH us ladies??? 
you just keep getting smoother, i cant handle all this smoothness
ohh... 
i guess that makes sense
ok i think i understand that!
yessss thanks dave <3 
um 
what do you mean rose will check out? :\
uhhhh ok
it does doesnt it 
how long? 
ok thats not THAT long :p
yaaaaaaaaaaaay!
oh hi! 
i remember you, you talked to me a lot in my dreams 
yup! 
thats because my dream self died 
pretty catastrophically! 
thanks, but i think im ok 
i felt pretty shaken up at first though 
yeah i have done a lot of sleeping myself :) 
wow why did you sleep so much??? 
oh no what happened that was so terrible? 
ok sorry for prying! 
what did you want to talk about? 
permission for what? 
with bec? 
uh.... 
what do you mean by commune? 
and 
what do you mean the first time! 
you did it before? 
ohhh 
like a psychic power?? 
pretty sweet! 
when did you do it before?
hehe what?
omg...... 
that wasnt a senior interloper, im pretty sure youre talking about my grandpa!!! 
and if im interpreting correctly.... 
youre saying you used bec to make me shoot him??? 
augh thats so awful! 
oh boy 
ok it is basically an old man, who serves the same role as i guess a lusus does on your planet? 
he was like my dad, he took care of me! 
sigh... 
well im not blaming you or anything 
it sounds like you were just trying to help 
and you did save my life 
but...... 
i mean jeeeez 
talk about a misunderstanding
uh 
sure? 
.... it is? 
oh nooo 
how did that happen? 
:| 
ummm what kind of device? 
oh you mean a wheelchair! 
how... 
did that happen? 
D: 
im so sorry 
um also 
i didnt realize you were paralyzed 
not that im saying sorry for that! that would be rude i think 
i am just saying sorry for your loss 
oh? 
wow nice! 
um 
that..... 
i dont know if i agree with that! 
well 
thats good i guess 
i just wish... 
maybe you'd told me what happened when i was younger? 
i spent years wondering about it! 
when i was REALLY young, i was sure the doll sitting across from him did it 
and for a long time i was terrified of the evil blue girl!!! 
she sort of haunted my childhood and i had trouble sleeping for a long time 
but of course i got older and realized that was silly, but then i just speculated that maybe it was suicide 
which was just a really sad thing to think about!!! 
buuuut... 
even if you do, i dont remember you doing so! 
er 
ok :\ 
....... 
woooooow... 
you sound really confused to me! 
heheheh 
youre incredibly silly 
i cant really tell to what extent youre joking around here! 
rufio? 
what do you mean fake? 
ohh like an imaginary friend.... 
heh, ok 
that 
sure is a philosophy you have there! 
oh?? 
well, what is it? 
yes 
sure! 
red feelings? 
you mean 
whoooooaaaaaa 
wait 
really? :o 
um................. 
well 
i dont think i can reciprocate! 
i mean 
youre nice 
but i dont really know you... 
i dont even know your name! 
ok tavros 
i dont know if youve fully thought about this! 
you dont actually know me very well either 
well no 
i was being nice 
because 
i like to be nice to people when i can, and when they are nice to me 
but...... 
things are a little more complicated than that, you cant know someone just by a few conversations! 
i mean, i only talked to you when i was asleep! i am kind of different when im dreaming... 
i forget things, and at times im not totally sure whats real 
dont you remember thats what its like to dream on prospit? 
sorry, i feel bad about having to disappoint you... 
but i dont know what else to say 
jeeeeeez, um... 
tavros i am really flattered you like me and all 
and that sure is confident of you to say so! and thats great buuuut... 
i guess confidence is one thing but there is such a thing as being toooo forward i guess? 
i aaaalso think... 
and really this is just polite friendly advice! 
that if youre really confident you dont always have to say it all the time 
it... 
oh man im sorry to say 
it just comes of as a little insecure and off putting and kind of defeats the purpose! 
and all things considered i think we should just stay friends 
or really........ 
continue building a friendship in the first place, since like i said we dont actually know each other that well! 
sorry :C 
aaaah no! you should have self respect 
just... 
oh boy this is frustrating 
can we talk about this later? 
i have some things to do! 
why dont we get back to the original point 
why do you want to commune with bec again?
uh-ohhh 
what is your idea this time? 
wow, i dunno about that! 
but hes my best friend!!! 
and you have already managed to get one of my family members killed 
but all of our adversaries have inherited his powers! 
i would imagine the strongest guy would have all of his powers, and then some!!! 
i am really not comfortable with this 
you said you are asking me permission first and i appreciate that 
but if you are asking im afraid my answer is no! 
what? 
no way! 
that would be smug and arrogant and would make you a bully!!! 
later if my friends and i want to ask bec for help and decide thats our best hope, then thats our business 
until then, just please stop meddling!!!!!! 
nooooooooo dont dont dont dont dont 
im serious 
uuuuggghh i think my headache is coming back 
no... 
its fine 
i just really dont want you to do that ok? 
i have to go now 
bye tavros
it is the prettiest tree i have ever seen!!!!! 
ok great! 
everything about that makes total sense 
ok
is this conksucky enough 
<3 
well... 
i am not even sure if i am technically a u.s. citizen!
which one were you again? 
wait 
werent you the guy who was always trying to hit on me?? 
uh... 
but 
im the wwitch! 
i mean witch 
rose? 
i do not have a score to settle with rose!!! 
why would you think that? 
i think you are projecting your own attitude on to others 
just because you tend to hate and/or hit on everyone you meet doesnt mean everyone else is that way 
rose just sent me a code for a crystal ball, shes my friend and is basically the best! 
wait do you have a thing for her too??? 
did she reject you or something? 
:| 
uh huh... 
wow what are you talking about 
hey look at that, time for me to get going! 
no i dont want it!!!!! 
more like a legendary piece of shit! 
yes but i dont like you very much and i feel really icky about accepting a present from you 
siiigh 
fine 
what? 
oh...
hmmm... 
i have seen this before 
i am very sure its the same rifle included with johns present 
but... 
bigger of course 
yes but.... 
i did not provide the weapons! 
my penpal did 
the guy who helps me build the present 
we worked on it together but he supplied the bunnys weapons 
im pretty sure hes from the future! 
because he said hes my grandson 
umm yes 
oh no!!!!! 
aaaaa please dont tell anyone i told you about him! 
augh how could i let that slip to you of all people 
wow ok!!!! 
i wasnt going to say anything 
he didnt want me to tell my friends who he really was 
i guess maybe he was concerned about upsetting the timeline? i dunno 
maybe! 
i have wondered about that, assuming he is right... 
he was so nice, and it really did feel like i was talking to family, so i really dont think he was making it up 
i couldnt help but try to imagine his parents... 
and more interestingly....... 
his grandfather :O 
i still wonder who it could be... 
although i guess at this point 
the options are pretty limited :o 
like an heirloom? i guess it could be 
do you even have those? if you dont have parents how could you? 
ewwwwwwww 
hmmmm 
then maybe that is how this heirloom should work 
well i dont want to use it! 
so ill just dump it outside the house with the trash 
and if it is fated to find my penpal one day then so be it! 
maybe you should have been nicer to me! 
in any case i dont appreciate the spirit in which the gift was given so this is what i will do!
dave!!!!!! 
any dave out there please listen! 
dave i just saw you, and you were dead! 
you were in a green suit and covered in blood, oh god it was terrible :( 
if that was a future dave you have to make sure that doesnt happen!!! 
oh 
i am confused :o 
ok... 
i am still not sure i get that! 
but i guess i am relieved? 
wheeeew! there i just was 
how did that poor dave die? 
was it jack? 
D: 
what about your... 
um.... 
oh no i dont even know if you know about this 
;_; 
is it something you would like to talk about 
ghost dad??? 
oh... 
yes he mentioned something about it 
i guess i didnt realize its full implications.... 
but time was short when we talked! 
ugh i forgot i still have to get back to him 
its like a big unpleasant chore hanging over my head D: 
anyway dave im really sorry about your bro/dad 
you were pretty close with him right? 
heheh 
sure 
dave we have to stop him!!!!! 
jack! 
he shouldnt get away with this 
yes 
why dont you stop jumping around through time like a maniac and stop being like a hundred daves all the time and come to my house so we can make a plan to kill him?? 
oh :( 
what is the scratch? 
really?? 
hmmmm... 
so was that like a hint? 
about what im supposed to do :D 
well maybe im just being naive... 
but a crazy suicide mission does not sound like the ideal solution to me! 
are you suuuure we cant beat him? 
i dont know if we should rule it out! 
ok 
thanks dave!
hey tavros! 
i was thinking about your plan 
about uh... 
"communing" with my lusus :) 
maybe its not a bad idea! 
are you there? 
hmm, i guess you are off doing something else 
oh well, hope youre doing ok.... 
talk to you later!
hello! 
ummmmmm 
jade? 
can you talk? 
i... 
oh good! 
hehehe, i was starting to get worried there
what did you do...
what did you do???
WHAT DID YOU DO??????
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/whatdidyoudo.gif
uuugh 
what happened? 
boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo 
oh god 
what did you do what did you do what did you do 
oh no oh god..... 
what did i dooooo
um... jade? 
boo hoo hoooooo 
what is the matter? 
why are you so sad? 
what did you do to me?? 
i prototyped you and brought you back! 
should i not have? 
no! 
you shouldnt have, this is overwhelming and awful 
oh no, it is? 
yes! 
its hard to describe what its like 
but its too much for me 
and the sun... 
its way too big and bright and i cant stop seeing it... 
it wont go away aaaaah! 
:( 
thats terrible, im really sorry 
i guess i did not think this through 
cant this be undone? 
i was happy where i was with my friends 
i want to go back 
i dont think... 
that it can be undone :( 
BOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO 
woof :'( 
:o
well... 
now i dont know what to do 
i really messed up, i feel so bad 
i dont know what to do with myself either 
i think i will just go somewhere else 
i want to be alone 
where would you go? 
i dont know 
i think i can travel anywhere now 
but all id like to do is go back 
and i dont know if thats possible 
i wonder if theres a way... 
but you cant! 
i mean, not just yet, please? 
why 
i know you are upset jade 
but i did sort of bring you back for a reason 
why, why would you do this? 
we need your help! 
who? 
well, all of us here 
me and dave and rose and john 
john!!!!!!!!!!! 
oh noooooo, john... 
BOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO 
D: 
what is it now! 
john, poor john... 
id forgotten about him 
what do you mean, how could you forget about john??? 
it was so long ago! i put that sad memory behind me 
after we died i looked all over for him but couldnt find him 
and i was so lonely, but i finally got over it when i met my friends..... 
and now theyre gone toooo aaahhhh boooooooo hoo hoo hoo hoo 
but john didnt die! 
i saved him 
YOU saved him, dont you remember? 
you pushed him out of the way of prospits moon at the last minute, and hes ok now!!! 
oh my god prospit..... 
........... 
oh nooo jade please dont 
BOOOOOOOOOOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO 
:C
why are you doing this to me, why are you making me remember 
:( 
it was so beautiful and it was all destroyed before i even knew what was going on.... 
and so many nice people were killed 
i know jade i was there too... 
these are both our memories! 
and the queen, did she survive? 
and her ring, i was protecting her ring, oh noooo what happened to it??? 
jade, pleeease... 
i was just waiting for john to wake up, i was so sure it was going to be soon 
and i was going to show him around prospit 
i had so many things planned and so many friends to introduce him to... 
he was my best friend and i was looking forward to meeting him for so long 
but then it all burned down and everyone died and the moon fell and.......... 
stop... 
you are going to make me cry too, stop it!!! 
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo 
*sob* 
woooof... 
PFFheheh... *sob* hehehehehehe
i dont want to be here, i have to go back 
but i dont know how 
can you help me? 
you want me to help you... 
die again? 
yes, i think thats what i would like 
i cant take this, i wasnt ready to come back 
not like this 
wow... 
ok, i know this is my fault 
but that is a really hard thing to ask me to do! 
even if it was possible the way you are now 
i dont think i could go through with it :( 
boo hoo hoo hoo hoo 
ok ok shhhhh... 
jade listen 
i never did tell you why i brought you back 
and it may be that 
if you attempt what i wanted you to do in the first place 
god i cant believe im saying this... 
but you might end up getting what you want anyway 
because it was always going to be risky 
what is it? 
well, you remember the guy who destroyed prospit? 
oh god D: 
ohh god noooooo... 
shh!!! 
anyway, he is the reason i brought you here 
he has the same powers you have, making him unbeatable to us... 
but maybe not you! 
so you could go find him and 
you want me to fight him??? 
um 
are you crazy? do i look like i am ready to fight anybody??????? 
i just thought 
as long as youre here 
i cant fight anybody! 
jade i am scared and confused and sad and... 
i wouldnt even know how to begin fighting that horrible guy 
i would be too afraid of him to even go find him 
but 
i thought you wanted to die? 
you wouldnt go even if he could... 
no i dont want him to kill me!!! 
you just dont understand aaaaa boo hoo hoo 
jeez... 
youre right, i really dont 
BOO HOO HOO HOO 
i said SHH! 
wow 
jade... 
i dont mean to be insensitive but 
there is a lot at stake here! 
woof 
i... pfhehe, dont change the subject! 
i mean, dont you remember what this was all about? 
what you were working for... what WE were working for all those years before you died? 
remember what we saw in the clouds, or what the queen told us? 
uh... 
how could you not remember john survived? 
we both saw him in a cloud! he was in his dream suit and awake, reading our letter! 
didnt you think about that? 
ummmm, so? what does it matter? 
... 
it was all a lie jade. what we saw in the clouds and all that. none of it meant anything 
what!!!!! 
how can you SAY that? 
it was a nice life, but everything we did lead to nothing 
john and i both died, and i eventually accepted that and moved on 
JOHN DIDNT DIE!!! 
omg... 
this is so frustrating, i just told you he didnt 
i knew i was kind of ditzy and forgetful in my dreams, but 
boooo ho- 
SHHHHH! okaaaaaay, jeez! 
i just dont know what to think 
i guess you are part of me, and you are who i was when i slept 
but it makes me sad to think i would act like this 
act like what? 
i would like to think that even if i was sad and scared, if i was put in a position where everyone depended on me, i could put all those feelings aside and do whats right! 
but i dont know whats right 
yes you do! 
even though you dont want to be, youre here now, and there are still people who need you 
there is still something worth fighting for!
no!!! 
not for me there isnt 
there is nothing but death and sadness and destruction here 
theres no hope, and i dont see anything worth fighting for 
that is a horrible thing to say! 
i dont belong here anyway 
really none of this is my business anymore and i want to go home 
AUGH! 
that is SO SELFISH!!! 
i cant believe this 
how can you say these things, dont you remember anything that the queen told us? 
that we would eventually build a new world and make a future together with our friends? 
dont you remember being excited about finding out what that meant? 
yes 
but it was just a story 
it was never going to come true 
yes it will!!! 
some of us, the ones who still have hope, are fighting for that RIGHT NOW 
how can you have such a negative outlook on absolutely everything? 
boo hoo ho- 
shut up!!!!!! 
stop being such a damn crybaby! 
really, we both had the EXACT SAME EXPERIENCES. and look, i am managing to keep my head up, see? 
you dont even have the full picture either, because you checked out early! 
you didnt have to stand by as bec gave jack his powers when you might have been able to stop that 
and you didnt have to watch as jack became so strong he could appear anywhere and kill anyone you loved at any moment! 
you didnt have to see a dave lying in his own blood :( 
what... 
dave? 
he died too? 
no, see... 
ohhhh boo- 
HEY! no. youre not allowed to cry about that because you DIDNT SEE IT 
thats the whole point!!! 
you are just looking for any excuse you can to be sad and useless and its starting to piss me off! 
*sniffle* 
no 
*whimper* 
NO. BAD. 
aaaaaaaBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO 
NO, FOR GODS SAKE WILL YOU SHUT UP AND PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, YOU ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH 
I SAID PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER YOU BLUBBERING GODDAMN PANSY 
AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO 
JUST SHUT UP. DRY YOUR CRYBABY EYES, STOP BEING A COWARD, AND GO FIGHT JACK NOIR!!!!!!!!!!!!
BOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO 
SHUT UP 
NO 
JUST 
GOD DAMN IT 
PLEASE 
JUST ONCE 
SHUT THE HELL UP 
SHUT UP 
SHUT   THE   FUCK   UP

http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005148
karkat!!!!! 
yes 
im going crazy here 
i never thought id say this, but im actually almost relieved to talk to you 
or really ANYBODY besides that lunatic 
SHE IS DRIVING ME NUTS!!!!!!! 
are you joking??? look at this mess! 
okay... 
i made the mistake of prototyping my dream self who has been dead for years 
and shes completely crazy and theres no talking any sense into her 
hmm? 
hmm what 
:\ 
what are you getting at??? 
well... 
i mean, i understand why she is upset 
but she is completely inconsolable, and wont listen to reason about anything! 
and i guess i could deal with that but... 
the frustrating thing is that shes actually me :( 
i really dont think i would act like that 
will you stop saying hmm!!!!!! 
fascination? 
what do you find so fascinating? 
my feelings? 
well... 
at first i was sad 
because she made me remember all the sad things that just happened 
but im trying to be strong about all that so we can keep moving forward 
and if i can then why cant she? 
but she just went on and on 
and i started getting angry... 
ugh i have never been so angry in my LIFE!!! 
I SAID STOP SAYING FUCKING HMM 
what does THAT mean????? 
is that supposed to be someone with a halo and goofy teeth? 
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME? 
oh 
haha oops 
yeah, pretty much 
considering what?? 
oh come on... 
this is NOTHING like that! 
because she's... 
well 
she's ACTUALLY INSANE 
but 
those are you 
im not her! 
i dont know 
it just... 
... 
oh my god 
youre right :(
so then i guess 
im a hypocrite :( 
wait... 
so me arguing with my dead dream self 
and smacking her around while screaming at her 
makes me SANE??? 
hahaha, wow 
you are so weird 
you want me to apologize?! 
for what, calling you crazy for arguing with yourself??? 
after taking so much crap from you for all those years? 
no forget it, im not apologizing that is BULLSHIT 
shut uuuup!!! 
what 
are you saying you want to apologize 
ok, i appreciate the THOUGHT of an apology, but i dont know if it really counts if you are just going to pawn off responsibility on your "past self" again! 
maybe your "present self" should own up to it! 
laaaaame 
hahahaha, that is so ridiculous 
why dont you stop it with all this nonsense and own up to being terrible unequivocally? 
:o 
hmmmm... 
yes, hm 
ok karkat, that sounds pretty sincere to me 
and youre right, i dont actually know you 
i just know the part of you who acted like a bully 
i understand there can be more to a person than just the stuff they say when theyre angry 
so i will accept your apology and give you another chance 
and i will apologize for calling you crazy 
obviously i am not in much position to judge :| 
so you say you have been talking to me from the future? 
ok, so what is the plan? 
i mean, why did you want me to contact you at this moment so badly? 
yes 
ok, i can do that 
but why, what does it do? 
its been here my whole life and i could never figure it out 
i dont think im following... 
you were told? 
by who? 
oh... 
future me? 
uh... ok 
well it sounds like a pretty good policy to me! 
hey!!! 
oh yeah! dave told me about that. 
what is it? 
ok then... 
what was the thing i told you to tell me to do? 
right now, i mean 
ok 
then what 
draw it? 
and then? 
password! 
I SAID PASSWORD FUCKASS!!!!! 
whoops sorry 
ive been having too many password arguments with karkat i guess :p 
well...... 
it depends, do you want to have a silly conversation or a serious conversation? 
both are! 
but a silly conversation mostly doesnt matter or make the timeline more confusing than it needs to be 
so we can have one right now if you want 
in fact i would say it is coming dangerously close to being one already! 
but if it is a serious conversation you want then im afraid i must demand a........ 
PASSWORD :P 
nope! 
because i told you 
exactly!!!!!!!!!!! 
hehehe 
yum :B ?????????????????????? 
hmm, i suppose those are acceptable 
to keep the conversations linear! 
i gave you a password at the end of our previous conversation 
you have to give me that password to start our next conversation 
this ensures that past you cant jump ahead into the conversation and mess everything up, like you are trying to do now! 
i know, but trust me its better this way :) 
i dont know, i have no idea what time you are from! 
but you will get it, i gave it to you some time ago at the end of our last conversation 
and i have been eagerly awaiting your linear and unconfusing reply ever since! 
bye kanaya <3
thanks i think! 
what do you mean by pre blackout rose? 
umm, ok... 
but what do you mean by blackout??? 
hmm @_@ 
im doing what you told me to do! 
im getting dave to set up that expensive equipment 
so i can start doing all that witch of spacey stuff you were telling me about 
which i appreciate, since my sprite turned out to be sad and useless, and not very wise at all :( 
oh 
what is a sylph? 
a magical witch??? 
thats awesome 
breeding duties?????
uhhhhhhhhh... 
please tell me that doesnt involve what it sounds like! 
it sounds like 
it involves 
a lot of breeding :\ 
oh 
does the equipment we are deploying have anything to do with it? 
ok then, thats pretty neat 
yeah, whew <_<; 
how so? 
what is your role? 
whoa, cool! 
so you are like bugs, like bees or ants or such, but with horns 
:o 
errr....... 
yes 8|
what!
you think so?
i think you can do it! 
yes... 
didnt you say your lusus was a grub? 
thats perfect! 
if you were raised by a mother grub, then you are in a great position to raise one yourself 
it is like... 
a sort of family legacy! 
a really cool alien family legacy
dont mention it! 
so how does this cloning stuff work? 
i want to try anyway! 
if you can hold out hope for rebuilding your race in the center of a meteor, then i think i can at least try to get a little cloning done with the time i have left 
yes, dave is doing that at the top of this ridiculous tower 
didnt you say it needed to be in a warm place? 
my house is freezing now 
it ran on geothermal power before... 
and i guess theres no heat anywhere inside this planet 
yes i would like to hear about that later... 
but yeah the weather seems just fine out here in the medium! 
lets see how dave is doing.....
its... 
so small :o 
but 
clone babies can barely even fit on that thing! 
i mean young humans!!! 
you know, that we milk producers nurture hatchless within? 
then what is the objective? 
what am i breeding???? 
:O 
i cant get over how tiny this thing is! 
its so cute 
so the baby frogs show up on this pad here? 
i cant wait to try it 
oh 
lol 
dave just has a lot of funny stuff to say about all this 
oh you know, a bunch of silly stuff 
theres too much to copy/paste! 
here ill save it all to a file and send it to you
hahaha 
alright how do i get started!
ok, here is a frog on the screen 
on no, is it trapped in ice? 
was your planet covered in ice too? 
cool! 
anyway, i will try to rescue this frog 
so i push this button to appearify it? 
ok........
oh god, it is still a frogcicle!!!! 
this will not do 
i dont understand! 
but i am intrigued... 
ok, that makes sense i think 
how can i appearify some frog slime? 
so it is like 
a sort of backwards frog breeding 
clone first, catch later? 
ok, i will try this 
heheh, look at this handsome guy here, hiding in the woods and being sneaky 
he looks frozen solid too 
so if i go bother him later, that means if i try to take him now i will only get slime right??? 
that sounds like fun!!!!!!! 
hmmmmm 
k hang on while i clone this fella.....
yaaaaaay!!! 
i will think of something... 
i wont let the poor little guy suffocate!
so i am supposed to wait for him to grow up, and then breed him with other frog paradox clones? 
it is? 
huh... 
so what is the actual purpose of all this breeding? 
am i trying to make one really special frog with just the right genetic code or something? 
sort of like the ULTIMATE FROG :O 
oh! 
why? 
him? 
so he is a boy frog? 
the speaker? 
hehehe 
CROOOOOOAK 
then the speaker is like a god, but there are a lot of them? 
like one for each session, kind of like the kings and queens? 
it is pretty catchy... 
if i call him that i will be sure to say i mean no offense! 
thats good 
ok then what? 
what do we do after i make this big god froggy? 
does it have something to do with the new universe we create? 
you said he was a genesis frog 
does that mean we bring him into the universe and... 
he makes new planets or life or such? 
really??? 
yes i got that! 
you mean he is LITERALLY a universe? 
but your species is too! 
especially karkat, he is incredibly sarcastic 
but i dont do that! 
i try to say what i mean as much as i can 
from what? 
haha, you mean from rose? 
yeah, rose and dave are like that all the time! 
they inculcate that stuff like crazy 
so you have been talking to her a lot i guess? 
are you best friends now?? 
why? 
oh yeah, because you said she is blacked out? 
what the heck does that mean! 
yeah, i didnt like the sound of her plan either! 
you did??????? 
yeah! :D 
jeez, i hope not... 
me too!!!!! 
wow kanaya i did not realize how much we had in common 
well, it sounds like helping people is something that is in your nature 
i can understand that 
are you saying rose is reckless and dangerous? 
you mean your guardian? 
uh oh... 
im not sure why, but the sound of that makes me really nervous 
she didnt mention anything about this when we talked 
but then she seemed preoccupied 
yeah, i will! 
lol yeah i guess so! 
ok, you can go do that, and i guess i will check on rose, but... 
theres still so much i want to know! 
i want to know more about stoking the forge and breeding the frogs, and about your time on prospit and all that! 
yes! <3 
if i have cause to? 
oh!!! 
that reminds me, i was thinking of implementing a system to keep some of these confusing conversations simple and linear 
yeah! i guess someone told you? 
aaaaa you see?????? 
you nearly just gave me the idea for the plan in the first place paradoxically from my own future self!!! 
i just find that kind of thing annoying for some reason, it doesnt feel right... 
i would rather ideas came from the place they actually came from 
ok lets put the system in play starting now! 
i will give you a password, and you give it to me in the future when you want to pick up this conversation again 
the password is............... 
CROOOOOOOOOOOAK 
it must be in all caps, and must contain precisely ten Os! 
whoops! 
eleven then :p 
kanaya :o 
that sounded 
just a weeeeeee bit 
sarcastic ;D 
you are just becoming multicultural, thats all 
i think i am learning to be more multicultural through karkat as well 
it mostly involves saying fuck a lot 
heheheheh, its ok, hes really not so bad 
ok! go hatch that orb! 
i will be waiting 
later!
john!!! :D 
wow, finally! 
nope! 
dave was able to set up as my server player 
he is building up my house right now so that we can deploy some equipment up there 
yep! 
:o 
thats ok, i wont tell him about it 
well, maybe you can..... 
i will try to put in a good word for you B) 
im not sure! 
something to do with cloning i guess? it serves some purpose in my quest as witch of space 
a nice troll named kanaya has been advising me on stuff about that 
have you talked to her? 
you should! 
a bunch of trolls are not nearly as bad as i thought 
even karkat! he has been helping me too... sort of, hehe 
oh yeah, he said plenty of stuff like that, but i dont think he ever actually meant it 
flying off the handle is part is of his charm in a funny way, once you know that about him 
heheheh 
shhhhhhhhh 
yeah! 
hmm what else... theres been so much going on, its been a little hard to keep track of it all! 
why dont you tell me what youve been up to first? 
.............. 
whoa :O 
john where did you get that nice flying car?????? 
sort of! 
she gave me the code, and i made a cool pair of goggles with it 
it certainly seems so! what with your fancy magic car 
and your chauffeur familiar, i guess? 
you did??? 
:( 
hmmmmm... 
maybe, but hang on let me try something 
yes! 
what have you seen? 
:O 
like what, what did you seeeee? 
frogs? 
no... 
sure does! 
nope! but that sounds pretty interesting 
i wonder why i would be surrounded by frogs? 
hahaha thats true! 
i hope i am not planning on putting them in a cauldron or anything o_o 
whew! 
bluh. yes :| 
i prototyped my dead dream self and tried to get her to fight jack 
but it turned out to be a BIG MISTAKE 
god i cant believe how dumb that idea was, she was an emotional wreck 
oh, she went off to cry somewhere else... good riddance! 
hehe i guess so 
what!!!!!
oh noooo 
who? 
i dont think so! 
well if she tricked you into getting killed, then i would have to agree 
what process? 
and how are you alive now if you died! john im a little confused 
ohhhhhh! 
that makes sense 
dave had mentioned you reached the god tier 
but he did not say what it involved D: 
he probably didnt want to make me worried 
or that! 
but he also said that no one else would do it but you... 
actually, now it makes sense that i wouldnt be able to, since my dream self is dead 
its too bad really 
i wonder what space powers would be like?? 
oh well 
!!! 
youre right... 
i suddenly dont know if i want to become a god tier anymore :( 
DX 
i dont even want to talk about her! she is sad and cowardly. 
why dont you tell me about your new friend? 
he sure seems to be enjoying that horn!
haha! what is he doing with that! 
probably! 
you are just going to have to deal with the fact that you are becoming a famous hero john, and people everywhere will idolize you 
:o 
thats great! john you have to get that ring from him! 
hmmmmmmmmmm 
that is a problem! 
you do? 
and what? 
8O 
ok john..... 
i trust you 
so i will trust in your trust in him 
im going to be a supportive piece of shit all day and fall down all this trust! 
lol 
john, i already found your dad!
yes i found him with my goggles almost right away! 
but i didnt want to interrupt you 
he is with roses mom 
they are in a castle, having some sort of tea party together 
they appear to be enjoying each others company! 
its quite adorable actually 
RED ALERT!!!!!! 
AWOOOOOOOOOOOGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
durrrr oh really john :p 
but really, they make a nice couple and i think it would be great if they got married! 
i guess so 
yes they are pretty special 
i dunno 
who are they to stand between two youngsters in love? 
yes john, two people must be in love in order to get married 
it is one of the rules! 
so what do you say john, are you in love with rose? 
and if not, are you prepared to fall in love with her? 
wellllll? :D 
i didnt even know karkat made a shipping diagram... 
i will have to make him show me 
<_<; 
whaaat... 
i dont know about that! 
i clearly need to take a good hard look at this prophetic document 
and possibly tell karkat what an idiot he is! 
uh 
well, i dont actually know where he is relative to you! 
so i dont know if i can give you directions 
there might be some way to do that... 
these goggles are actually REALLY COMPLICATED! 
i will look into it and get back to you 
in the meantime, why dont you fly around and keep looking? 
at least now you know to look for a castle 
and maybe the clouds will give you some more tips! 
sure! <3 
later!
rose jeez!!! 
finally 
you sure seem to be absorbed in whatever youre doing on that computer... 
were you talking to someone? 
oh no no i dont blame you for not responding! 
you must be very upset 
are you ok? 
um 
because 
uhhh i figured you would have found out by now but i guess you still dont know? 
about... 
johns dad 
and....... 
your mom :( 
rose? 
hello??? 
oh noo :'(
rose please say something 
you are making me nervous... 
umm 
because you were busy trying to make the best of this situation? 
i dont think you should be so hard on yourself about it 
john was being john, and you were being you, which i guess meant taking our problems very seriously and putting all your attention on solving them! 
and anyway, you and your mom had a much trickier relationship than john and his dad didnt you? 
i mean, not that i am saying that means you were any less attached to her than him... 
argh, i dont know if im very good at consoling people. sorry rose i dont want to make you feel worse :( 
whew, ok 
you know... 
now we have all lost guardians 
dave lost his, and i lost mine in a weird way... uuum even though that was pretty much definitely my fault :\ 
and even the trolls all lost their monster guardians 
i think that maybe it is an inevitable part of a game that can be cruel sometimes 
...... 
i am so sad 
rose i think you are being stronger about it than i am 
oh 
well 
i just hope you arent thinking of doing something rash 
yeaaah... 
errrr, i dont know? 
wellllll 
no! 
but i was trusting that you had thought it through and it was our best hope 
hm 
then what will you do? 
what does that mean! 
oh no no no no no! 
rose that is a much much worse plan!!!!! 
he would probably kill you! 
i know what you mean, i was angry at jack and wanted to stop him too, but we have to think of a more sensible way to do it 
what? who? 
aaaaaaa whaaaaat????? 
rose who is this! 
i dont even know whats going on anymore 
SHHHHHHHHHH! 
please dont rose, i know you are angry but you arent thinking straight 
nooo :( 
rose, maybe white text guy is right? 
the dark gods gave you all these powers, and seem to be helping us with dream bubbles and stuff... 
but what if they are not actually good? 
no... 
but i still dont trust them! 
whats this weirdo talking about! 
oh yeah 
i noticed you found it! 
i was worried it had been destroyed when my room blew up 
is he saying you can use it? 
omg 
does it work??? 
then maybe you should try it! 
well 
since we dont know much about the gods... 
why dont you ask it about them? 
i guess that is a way to put it
john!!! i am worried about rose! 
im pretty sure she is on her way there to look for jack! 
i cant say for sure because i cant see her with my goggles anymore for some reason, but i am fearing the worst 
just in case, you should to try to intercept her before she does something stupid like try to fight him!!!!! 
also, um... 
i guess you probably still dont know about your dad yet do you? 
darn, why do i always have to be the one to break terrible news :( 
er 
john?
oh god please dont tell me your computer was in the wallet you just gave that guy..... 
dammit john!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
one of these days you will learn the value of having plenty of backup computers 
in fact whenever you finally leave the battlefield i am going to give you the code for a nice pair of lunchmuffs 
and then i am going to force you to keep them on your head AT ALL TIMES! 
yeah, youre never going to read this are you :|
dave?
are you ok? 
what happened to you? 
um... 
i died in my dream and came back as a dog 
:o
what is that? 
yes 
how did you get it? 
yes i figured shenanigans were probably involved 
can you be more specific? 
dave? 
oh yeah 
im supposed to help jade too, but...... 
*sniffle* 
ok, ill try... 
you were saying? 
the forge? 
ohhh 
i did? 
yeah 
shes a lot more brave than me i think 
she brought me back thinking i could help her and all i did was disappoint her and everyone else 
you came back as a sprite and youre managing to do important things... 
but i just feel so scared and helpless 
i dont know if i would have if i had the chance 
but i would like to not feel so useless to everybody 
what about your sword? isnt it important? 
im still not sure how you got it... 
what does it have to do with my volcano? 
but i thought the denizens were supposed to be asleep? 
at least until you do the right things on your quest...
what choice 
what did you choose? 
what happened when you saw him this time? 
you mean _Choice!_ 
_hehehe_:p_ 
oops 
so it was the same choice?
then what did he make you decide?
as opposed to what? 
oh... 
yeah ._. 
probably something amazing 
she is still working so hard to help everyone 
i guess i used to be that way... 
but ive completely forgotten how
whats happening? 
can we do something to stop it? 
i dont know..... 
i like it here though 
i felt like i was drawn to come here when i wasnt sure where to go 
the meteors 
and all the fire... 
it reminds me of when i died 
and i was trying to wake john up 
i was scared then too 
but i didnt let the fear stop me from trying to save him 
i have no idea 
i guess try to help 
what is there to do? 
oh noo 
does that mean youre going to leave? 
:( 
you mean... 
that i should give him the sword? 
but i dont want to leave you here either 
oh yeah! 
alright, i will try.....
pw. 
listen fuckass 
i am going to need a password before we continue 
plz <3 
....................... :| 
no karkat, that was not quite the password 
but you were on the right track :p 
do you even remember the right password? 
youre being deliberately dumb 
it was... 
IF I HATE MYSELF SO MUCH, THEN WHY DON'T I HATEMARRY MYSELF? 
remember? 
i was just using the password system to poke a little fun at you, and you turn it into this whole overdramatic thing, jeeeeez. 
i wonder if we will ever be able to start a conversation without having a ridiculous argument about the password system? 
why would i want to do that?? 
the only guy whos dumber than past karkat is future karkat, and vice versa! 
i have this on good authority from both sources 
you see, that is your problem 
okay, one of your many, many problems... 
you have no patience to do things the right way, youre always just looking for the shortcut! 
even if doing so has brought you nothing but trouble a hundred times before 
it is sort of funny that the only thing standing in your way is one of your other problems, your preposterous self loathing 
so you cant even trust your future self to help you cheat! 
its like you have so many problems, they cancel each other out 
exactly :D 
ok 
yes 
yes, we still are! 
this little detour was related to that task. we should be nearly done. 
i can understand her just fine! 
we already talked about this 
echidna and i have an understanding now ;) 
well maybe if you werent in such a grumpy hurry all the time you wouldnt have killed your denizen so quickly 
you might have actually learned something!!!!!! 
did you ever talk to kanaya about it? 
her situation was very similar to mine 
it doesnt sound like you got the whole story 
or maybe you just werent listening to her :p 
this was kanayas suggestion 
yes! 
im talking to her right now actually 
durrr, of course not, shes from a different time than you genius 
a few hours in your future! 
you are so ridiculous, i have kanaya using the same password system as you 
she is just a little further ahead on my timeline is all 
it would be pretty hard to keep you both synced up! 
yeah, from MY future, i dont want you guys telling me the things i do before i do them because you talked to future me! 
but knowing a few things about your future doesnt really matter, NOT that i am going to tell you any of it, so dont ask 
siiign, what are you even talking about? 
aw 
well... 
youll find him 
i know, i made an exception 
but only one! 
kanaya thinks we should all talk about this 
she says youre important to consult on the matter, but the you from her time is too busy 
:x!!!!! 
she is opening a memoyeah... 
its ok though. as long as he is tailing me like a lost puppy, at least hes not killing anybody 
i remember the episode!!! 
but hes ok now 
and im kind of starting to think that was just his way of saying hi 
my dog used to fetch my bullets too! 
i really think he believes he is my dog, on some level 
dont worry, im keeping my eye on him 
aaaaaa no no no, bad jack, bad!!!!!!yeah... 
the poor froggies :( 
youre probably right, they really seem to drive him crazy 
this is not the first time i have had to reprimand him 
he was growling at echidna and i had to tell him he was being very bad 
he destroyed some of her really nice statues too 
keeping him in line really makes me miss bec, he was such a good dog 
not to mention a best friend 
jack is just... 
exactly 
huh? 
but you are a programmer arent you? that is at least kind of like being a scientist, having some technical savvy... 
we know! you are clearly very good at being all of those things 
but now we need your help with frog science. can you help us?shhhhhhhshhhshhshshsh..... 
SHOOSH 
no future talk!!! lets stay on topic 
kanaya means she is a very pretty girl with pointy fangs who has a bright sunny complexion and wears fancy dresses 
and... 
she drinks blood >_> 
hee hee 
yup :) 
karkat... 
that information qualifies as.......... 
FUTURE STUFF! 
no wait! just please listen a little longer? 
not exactly... 
she just helped me remember 
something from my past 
if i accepted her terms 
yeah because you never told me yours!!! 
hmm 
yeah she made me promise to do something that sounds impossible too 
except...... 
i actually agreed :o 
i have no idea how im going to keep my side of the bargain, now that I think about it 
oh right 
where the last frog is! 
or was... 
the thing is 
the frog we need is nowhere to be found in the medium 
it was on earth! 
but only very briefly 
it was when i was young 
before i woke up on prospit 
i had begun sleep walking 
both on the island and on the moon 
and in my dream it was very bright 
i saw something in the light 
i couldnt tell what it was so i got closer
but before i got there i woke up 
and found myself by the lagoon surrounding the ruins
i was about to walk home 
when i saw something appear on a lily pad 
it was a frog! 
an amazing shiny frog, not like any other ive seen in the lagoon
it hopped over to me and i picked it up 
but then, just like that...
it died
later my grandpa made a robot for me to help me with my sleep walking 
it could do all the walking while i stayed safe in bed! 
it could also record my dreams 
i am sure he always knew my dreams were going to be special 
i suspect he knew it before i was even born
hopefully! 
no, it completely slipped my mind 
well, like it was before 
the choices she gives you seem to have to do with facing mortality 
and making it clear if you choose one path over another it will lead to your death 
and that your death may even be necessary to accomplish a goal 
yeah 
but 
that is not really what made this hard 
i mean 
nobody wants to die of course 
but at least... 
that is a clear thing 
you either do you you dont 
you know? 
it might be 
she said 
that if i accepted her help 
that i would have to make a promise 
that whenever we left this place 
and wherever we end up going 
she had to come 
not just echidna but all the denizens 
their palaces their consorts their lands... 
everything 
i have to bring them all with us
oh sorry! 
i was distracted 
no not by all the scratchy stuff in the sky 
theres something coming down...
its hard to make out 
but 
i think 
it might be...
shaving cream?
its like 
hey! 
... 
karkat?
im not sure! 
some sort of limbo dimension between the two walls i guess 
like a realm with unusual spatial properties we have to cross through 
yes! 
we still totally exist john
about what? 
yes 
i didnt make it with witch powers though, i captchalogued it hours ago because karkat told me to... 
then at the last minute i took it out and made it huge so we could escape through it 
i did make it huge with witch powers! 
they also make things small 
yup 
also 
witch powers can teleport things, and fling things around through space at very high velocities 
all sorts of stuff! 
but to be honest, im not sure how much of that is attributable to inheriting becs abilities... 
yes that was the basic idea 
that would be jake 
and yeah, i do believe we will meet him in this session 
he said he had a bunch of friends who helped him make the bunny! im pretty excited to meet them all 
actually, they both went, and in a manner of speaking, their mission was a success 
nope! 
they did not actually destroy the sun. trust me, i would know if it was gone. now that i know what i know, it was kind of silly of us to think it would ever be destroyed... 
and as it happens, rose and dave are not dead either! i have received very reliable reports that they survived 
it will all be more clear soon 
ive learned a lot in my dreams lately 
heh, probably more than i ever learned looking at the clouds on prospit! 
when i was dead there for a few minutes, i had one last very informative nap 
the bottom line is, rose and dave will rendezvous with the trolls near the green sun, and then they will all meet us in the new session
its through the other wall! 
yes 
no, not lawn ring! 
thats a silly troll word 
its the yellow yard 
we have to cross it to break through the next wall 
see that long yellow band down there, stretching between the two walls? 
i think thats supposed to be the yard 
hmmm 
yeah i think youre right 
kinda like the yellow brick road? 
hehe
:| 
i have no idea 
extra dimensional shenanigan based phenomena perhaps????? 
i dont know! 
:? 
yes me too 
hmmmmmm
im just trying to estimate our arrival time 
based on our current velocity, which is about as close to light speed as i can make it go 
hmmmmmmmmmmm... 
no 
itll take quite a bit longer than that 
i would say 
if i keep our speed constant... 
we should arrive in about three years 
i know! 
i cant! 
not here, at least 
the way i understand it is... 
becs powers draw from the green sun 
and the green sun presides over our universe 
many universes actually! and the sessions that created them, as well as the sessions created within them 
including the trolls universe and their session 
think of it like a giant solar system, but instead of planets revolving around the sun, there are many universes 
it is! 
so, bec was able to teleport anywhere in the universe he wanted in an instant, much faster than light 
jack was able to do this too, within our session, and then when i inherited those powers from jadesprite, so could i 
but we could only teleport locally 
which means, bec could jump to anywhere in our universe, but not to another universe, or into a session 
and jack could jump to anywhere in our session, but not outside it 
we cant even jump to the green sun itself, even though we sort of serve as a gateway to it, and all its energy 
and once we leave the suns domain, our travel is limited by the speed of light, like everyone else! 
for example, the furthest ring is not in the suns domain 
it is more like the suns medium, allowing it to exist 
so if i wanted to fly out of our session and travel to the green sun, i would have to make my way there through the furthest ring at the speed of light or less 
and wherever we are now is not in the suns domain either 
so the same rules apply 
yes i think youre right 
but to be fair, we were all the victims of a big prank! 
some really creepy omniscient guy 
it doesnt matter much, hes supposedly dead now 
yes, but its not all as bad as it seems 
theres a silver lining in all of this 
like you said, a sun presiding over many universes has to be pretty cosmically important 
who knows what terrible consequences there would be if it was destroyed 
or maybe worse, if it never existed at all 
which is what made rose and daves true mission an unintended success! 
to deliver the bomb to the empty location the green sun was meant to exist for most of eternity 
and then create the sun in the first place 
that is what the tumor was for all along 
like i said 
we got played like a bunch of suckers!!!
i think he looks cool!!!!! 
the cape is great, hes like a super hero now 
yup 
... 
:( 
!!! 
........... 
how did you know about that! 
oh 
that figures 
umm 
yeah 
i dunno 
do you want it to come true? 
hmmmmmm..... 
i think i miss them already 
and weve only been here for a few minutes :( 
well 
you could ask them now if you want 
yes 
in fact 
you can hop right through me and join them 
then you can travel with them to the new session if you like 
it probably would! 
but i cant go with you 
i can serve as a gateway 
but i cant travel to the sun myself, remember? 
but its ok, really! 
if thats what you wanted to do, i wouldnt mind 
but whatever you do, you have to decide quickly 
they will be departing from the sun very soon 
i wouldnt really be alone though
i have the population of five planets to keep me company! 
awww :D 
ok then 
personally, i think this trip could be a lot of fun! 
theres no pressure to do anything important or run around like lunatics anymore 
we can just relax 
woof! 
whoops 
there should be lots of good stuff on the planets 
also i would bet this ship is stocked with plenty of military rations 
oh yeah!!! 
durrr, problem solved 
yes 
im pretty sure she knows a ton of things now 
considering she is a fully realized seer of light 
im sure that would be hilarious 
but 
if you go i dont think i can bring you back 
i cant bring anyone or anything to here from there! 
as far as i know... 
if theres a way i havent figured it out yet 
i am still kind of new to this omnipotence thing after all :\ 
i dont know! 
im sure the rules exist for a good reason though 
maybe to somewhat limit the power and reach of omnipotent beings? 
if there are no limits at all, it could be especially dangerous in the wrong hands 
like what happened with jack! 
then i guess thats what we are! 
semipotent demigods 
woof woof woof! 
dammit!!!!!! 
i havent gotten the hang of the woofs yet :( 
i think so 
i do too! 
D:
sure! 
better hurry up and write it though 
how about this one? 
looks like its still in pretty good condition 
john you have to hurry! 
here, will this work? 
whatever you write just make it quick! 
and tell everyone i say hi! 
ok, while you work on that, i think ill bring up some friends 
you know, let some of our travel companions get acquainted with the ship!
shooooooooosh!!!!! 
write now, catch up later!
nooooo come on guys theyre about to go just stuff it in the bucket and throw it at me already!!! 
john i really think we are scraping the bottom of the barrel here 
thats sort of my point! 
where did you even get this? 
:|
i dont really think this is my kind of game.... 
but i will play it with you today because it is technically your birthday <3 
how many people did you get to play this?? 
why cant you cross the streams? 
:p
im working on it! 
there are so many options 
what kind of ghostbuster should i make? 
hmmmm 
what do you have to do? 
noooooooooo! 
sure john 
whatever you say 
are you serious? 
what about that fire pole there? 
cant you go down the fire pole? 
......... 
yeah i think im done!!! 
im pretty happy with him
no way! 
hes adorable, what are you even talking about? 
i dont want ghosts to be afraid of him 
i want to make friends with some ghosts if at all possible 
nope. im keeping him :p 
shut up or ill give him a pink jumpsuit! 
i think i will manage to survive the embarrassment in front of a bunch of salamanders and crocodiles 
thank you 
*snicker* 
nothing 
hehe 
pffff! 
its davesprite, hes playing too 
we have strategies? 
hahahahahahaha 
did you know... 
davesprite is a funny guy? 
i just told him you said that 
davesprite says to tell you "youre basically welcome for being born 14 years ago and 1 year ago you ungrateful douche" 
um 
because he is davesprite? 
well yeah 
but hes kinda different from dave 
i know 
but there are other differences...
its hard to explain 
just some slight differences in personality i guess 
yes... 
so? 
ok i will admit i cant really tell if his rapping style has changed 
i dont know if the differences are because he is a sprite 
or because he lived for a while in a different timeline... 
i wasnt a sprite! 
my dead dream self was a sprite 
and then i kind of merged with her when i became a god tier 
i guess? 
its more like im still the me i always was, but inherited some of her memories 
but they are pretty vague 
i remember being dead for a long time 
and making friends... 
mostly trolls 
none that we know of now 
that i can remember at least 
they feel like such distant memories, like they were barely real 
yeah me too 
maybe its something about this place were traveling through? 
when was the last time you visited one in your sleep? 
yeah 
yup 
nope :( 
i dont think thats it 
for one thing, considering where we are, i dont think theres such a thing as "the same time" for us 
maybe... 
but its probably more like the way it used to be with the clouds in skaia 
they didnt always show you things, but when they did they were selective about what they would let you see 
like they would make sure you saw whatever you needed to see to make sure things would go the right way 
i always thought i knew so much, but in retrospect they gave me only a tiny glimpse of the big picture! 
i guess! 
it never felt that way when all i was doing was looking up at some clouds 
i was happy to see whatever was there 
but i guess its different in a situation like this 
when you miss your friends, and you kind of wish the dream bubbles would play along 
heheh, probably! 
hmmm 
well look at it this way 
by the end of our trip, will YOU be better friends with a bunch of salamanders than you are with rose and dave? 
that is true 
umm 
what do you mean the way things are going? 
what! 
what has he been telling you?? 
well... 
i guess i dont know whats going on with that 
i really dont!!! 
um 
what 
do you think he would think about that? 
the other dave 
i mean 
hypothetically 
im only wondering because you brought it up!!!!!! 
then what do you think? 
maybe 
well 
what about you john? 
remember how you told me how karkat kept sort of trying to set you up with rose? 
you told me this on more than one occasion if i recall! 
well, i have kind of wondered to myself if you kept bringing that up because on some level you wanted that to be true... 
not at all! that is perfectly fine 
aww 
heheheheh 
what? 
*snicker* 
i guess you have a point 
mm hm 
yikes 
..... 
that was just my hunch 
i sincerely doubt it 
at least 
i hope not ._. 
that is so outrageous 
after you!
grrr... 
grrrrrrrrrrr 
i cant help it! 
grrrr... 
dammit! 
im really not mad at him, i swear! 
WOOF!!! 
WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF!
hm?
what?
whaaat 
but you love this movie!
but you were making such a big deal about finally getting me to watch it with you on your birthday! 
you were going on and on about how i wouldnt be disappointed... but now youre saying you dont like it? 
really? 
i was actually kind of enjoying it! 
its very silly 
i really dont think its the kind of movie youre supposed to take all that seriously john 
i dunno.... 
but people can change their minds about things 
i think youre allowed to change your mind about a silly movie 
i used to LOVE the squiddles show when i was really young 
but as i got older i started to realize it wasnt as great as i thought it was 
i was just too young to see how it was actually a flagrant vehicle for selling merchandise 
and if you believed the conspiracy theorists it might have even been pushing some other dark hidden agendas..... 
so i stopped liking the show itself as much but that didnt change the fact that i had a lot of fond memories about it 
i still loved all the cute characters and could enjoy it on a nostalgic level 
what is even the problem with it? 
ive just been watching this and thinking, yup, i can see why john was so obsessed with this movie... 
its funny! 
but he was trying to sound like a hardened criminal to win the trust of john malkovich! 
what!! 
you spent your whole life worshiping this dumb movie and now youre calling ME naive???? 
oh god 
vexing and hypnotic?? 
its a movie full of explosions about a guy with a mullet 
what is with you lately? you seem to be in such a crappy mood these days 
oh bluh bluh 
can we just finish the rest of the movie?
look you made us miss a whole bunch of stuff! 
hang on im going to rewind it... 
whos dave chappelle? 
no!!! 
dont touch the remote 
YES :p 
john you are kind of sounding like a crazy person here 
what??? 
oh... 
heh 
yeah 
why do you always call him dave sprite? 
no, i mean why do you always say it like that? with the space between words? 
its not dave sprite, its just davesprite 
yeah.... john 
i dont think davesprite is coming tonight
no... 
it has nothing to do with jaspers 
he uh... 
kind of broke up with me 
a couple days ago 
john its ok you dont have t... 
we were? 
your rock?? 
what are you talking about? 
we were not an institution! 
you are just saying meaningless things now 
um... 
its complicated 
basically hes just going through a lot of stuff right now 
do uh... 
you have a girlfriend? 
i dont think hes a douche, hes just... 
i dont think being a bird ever bothered him 
like i said... its all more complicated than that 
me too 
why? 
i dont know 
what do you mean 
uh 
so 
SO WHAT IF HE HAS A GHOST BUTT!!!!! 
WHATEVER YOURE JUST SAYING, JUST STOP SAYING IT! 
and whatever youre trying to gesture with your hands there, stop doing that too! 
nope!!! totally not talking about this 
put your hands down john
thats not down, thats up! 
oh well, at least youre not making those unsettling gestures... 
john... 
what are you doing? 
i hope youre not entertaining some awkward train of thought about, uh... 
what is with you?? 
today is your birthday, youre supposed to be having fun! 
but youve been so testy, as if youre committed to not having a good time 
yeah, i can see how you might find it a little slow here 
i dunno, i havent minded much... maybe its different for me though because i used to live all alone? 
but i dont mind doing that any time!!! 
john... if you told me this earlier i would have... 
were already going as fast as i can make us go 
about the speed of light! 
no! nothing can go faster than light john 
unless you teleport of course 
i already explained this! i cant do that here, its not within the domain of the green sun which gives me those powers! 
no thats just a regular law of physics!!! jeez 
ok first of all, thats not even close to the speed of light 
light travels at a hundred and eighty six thousand miles per second no matter what frame of reference youre in... even this one! 
second of all special relativity and comparing laws of physics between different frames of reference, those are tricky issues to talk about! 
but id be more than happy to talk about them if youd like. actually i would enjoy that because i never really get to talk about science wi... 
yes as a matter of fact it is! 
you take that back!!!!! 
john..... 
what is that?
under your hood... 
looks like a piece of paper stuck to your back? 
what? 
what is it?? 
where are you going? 
what! john, no... 
ok yes, that practical joke is in poor taste, but you should try to calm down and... 
um 
which one? 
sigh
:| 
john... 
theres no one there
what pastures 
what 
wasnt i supposed to be the mule? 
i dont think i understand your analogy 
.... 
john i think youre officially throwing a tantrum here 
... 
john?
john... 
are you asleep? 
please dont tell me you just fell asleep in your driveway
hi! 
are you jake? 
hi jake! 
im jade 
its nice to finally meet you! 
and you must be jane? 
mm hm!
