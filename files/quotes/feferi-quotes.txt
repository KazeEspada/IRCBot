CC: )(mm really?
CC: See t)(is is w)(y we s)(ould be comparing notes! 38O
CC: )(mmmmmm.
CC: Well I am going to join my team pretty late.
CC: I t)(ink I )(ave to!
CC: I will need to connect after my goofball moirail does so I can keep my goggles on )(is nefarious escapades.
CC: Its a toug)( job but its important! Everyone )(as an important job to do.
CC: Isnt t)(at w)(at youre doing too? Joining late to keep an eye on yours?
CC: )(a)(a youre not supposed to know for a FACT dummy!
CC: You just do w)(at you t)(ink is rig)(t and even if you were wrong t)(e worst t)(at )(appened was you )(elped somebody and )(elped t)(e w)(ole world too!
CC: Glub glub glub glub S)(RUG.
CC: Yes probably!
CC: Your clouds tell you everyt)(ing so w)(at do you even )(ave to worry about?
CC: T)(ats true.
CC: O)( s)(ucks now Im going to get sad.

CC: T)(oug)( I guess it will be a relief not to )(ave to worry about keeping )(er voice down anymore!
CC: T)(ey arent burdens!
CC: Ok I guess t)(ey are )(a)(a.
CC: But I love t)(em and I wouldnt )(ave it any ot)(er way because t)(is is w)(y Im )(ere!

CC: KANAYA BY----------------------------E!
CC: ?
CC: Glub glub!
CC: 38)
CC: W)(at is it!!!
CC: I am wondering if you can forego t)(e exaggerated emotional t)(eatrics for once and actually tell me w)(at's on your mind!
CC: 38|
CC: Yes I do.
CC: We are supposed to talk to eac)( ot)(er, t)(at is w)(at moirails are for.
CC: Glub glub glub glub siiiiig)(.
CC: Will you take t)(e c)(ip off your nub and tell me w)(at's t)(e matter?
CC: Are you fretting over anot)(er one of t)(ese dumb contraptions?
CC: No I'm not! But t)(at is beside t)(e point.
CC: None of your plots to kill t)(e land dwellers ever work out, and every doomsday device you get your )(ands on turns out to be a piece of junk!
CC: I t)(ink deep down you stack t)(ese plots against you so you fail because you know it's wrong.
CC: T)(is is t)(e last time I will say t)(is.
CC: W-E AR-E NOT B-ETT-ER T)(AN ANYBODY!!!!!
CC: GLUB. >38(
CC: If you're as sickened by t)(em as you say, w)(y do you spend so muc)( time on land?
CC: You can't )(ave t)(e sort of affinity for "our kind" t)(at you profess if you've only spent, w)(at...
CC: A few days underwater, maybe? IN YOUR W)(OL-E LIF-E!
CC: W)(at about your friends? Do you ever t)(ink about t)(em?
CC: If t)(ey are beneat)( you t)(en t)(ey )(ave to die too.
CC: And I know you like talking to some of t)(em. You say you )(ate t)(em but I t)(ink you are pretending!
CC: Mmm )(mm.
CC: I )(ave a fis)(y feeling...
CC: T)(at t)(is stupid doomsday mac)(ine t)(ing is just anot)(er excuse to consort!
CC: Wit)( someone in particular...
CC: 38P
CC: 38O
CC: DON'T YOU GLUB IN T)(AT TON-E OF GLUB WIT)( M-E MIST-ER!
CC: O)( S)(IT, you are angling for SO MUC)( TROUBL-E NOW.
CC: )(-E)(-E ok. 38)
CC: Um, I guess?
CC: I wouldn't really know.
CC: Sometimes people just drift away I t)(ink, or just aren't as into t)(e quadrant as t)(e ot)(er wants to be.
CC: So you really t)(ink your feelings for )(er run t)(at dark?
CC: T)(at is so ridiculous, any girl would be lucky to )(ave a kismesis as diabolical as you, especially T)(AT one.
CC: W)(o knows w)(at )(er problem is! S)(e )(as issues.
CC: You know, I'm not sure w)(y we never talk about our romantic aspirations.
CC: We s)(ould more often. It is kind of -EXCITING!
CC: Probably because you fill your gossip quota wit)( your nubby )(orned bro.
CC: You leave not)(ing left to talk about wit)( your dear sweet moirail!
CC: We are supposed to )(elp eac)( ot)(er wit)( t)(at stuff too, remember.
CC: Your stupid fis)(y face is w)(at's odd!
CC: )(AV-E YOU -EV-ER T)(OUG)(T ABOUT T)(AT??
CC: Um...
CC: Yea)(. I can't t)(ink of anybody I feel t)(at way about. 38\
CC: Maybe I am just not old enoug)( to )(ave t)(ose feelings yet? We are still pretty young you know.
CC: So ok. T)(ose are your black leanings.
CC: W)(at about R-ED, ------Eridan???
CC: )(MMMMM??????? 38D
CC: Is t)(ere a lucky lady you are waxing scarlet for?
CC: OR LUCKY F-ELLOW??? 38O
CC: Tell me!
CC: Don't pretend you're all -EMBARRASS-ED SUDD-ENLY!!!
CC: 38o
CC: 38(
CC: W)()()()()(-E-E-E-E-EW.
CC: Yea)(...
CC: Yes, it was a pretty close call, and got kind of complicated.
CC: But Sollux finally came t)(roug)(, and now I believe t)(e full c)(ain is complete!
CC: YOUR STUPID FIS)(Y FAC-E IS T)(-E DRAMA MAC)(IN-E T)(AT DO-ES NOT)(ING BUT W)(IN-E AND GLUB.
CC: 38P
CC: Anyway you s)(ouldn't say t)(at about )(im, )(e is a )(ero and )(e saved my life.
CC: O)(, really?
CC: T)(at's good! Actually, I )(ave somet)(ing I )(ave been meaning to say to you too.
CC: Mm, okay.
CC: But t)(is isn't easy to say!
CC: Okay, I )(ope so.
CC: I t)(ink...
CC: Now t)(at we are bot)( in t)(is game, and )(ave left our world be)(ind...
CC: And you can no longer pose t)(e danger to our people t)(at you )(ad always planned to...
CC: I t)(ink it is not really necessary for me to be your moirail anymore.
CC: 38(
CC: I am really sorry, -Eridan. It )(as just been so )(ard looking after you and keeping you out of trouble!
CC: It )(as taken its toll, and )(onestly I am really ex)(austed.
CC: I'm sorry!!! 38'(
CC: It will be t)(e best for bot)( of us. We can just sort of be...
CC: Regular friends instead.
CC: Uh...
CC: Okay, I am being serious and honest too. SEE?
CC: I am not sick of you, Eridan! I still really like you.
CC: In order to be destined for moirallegience, both people have to be on board, don't you think?
CC: But I cannot do it anymore. So I think it just wasn't meant to be all along.
CC: And really, you just don't need me anymore. You are free to do as you wish! We both are.
CC: I can't look after you anymore.
CC: Was what?
CC: Tell me!
CC: Oh?
CC: What do you mean?
CC: 38O
CC: No, I hadn't thought about it!
CC: Um...
CC: I really don't know about that.
CC: I do! But I don't know if it's really in that way.
CC: I've never had a chance to consider anything like that! I have just spent all my time worrying about you and trying to keep you from killing everybody or hurting yourself.
CC: It took all my energy.
CC: I don't think I have anything left for those feelings either.
CC: What?
CC: STOP!!!!!!!!!!!
CC: God.
CC: Will you just clam up for once in your life?
CC: Always carping and carping and carping!
CC: You go completely overboard with your emotions, always looking to reel in drama wherever you can.
CC: I am up to my gills in it! I just can't salmon the strength anemonemore.
CC: HEHEHE, sorry.
CC: But really, this shouldn't be as bad as it sounds.
CC: When all is said and done, I am still your friend.
CC: We have left our world behind. Everyone is dead, and there's no use in worrying about it now.
CC: It's over! It is time to play this game and focus on building something new and ------EXCITING.
CC: So )(ang in t)(ere, -Eridan.
CC: I )(ave to go now! Sollux is in serious trouble, and I )(ave to go )(elp )(im.
CC: BY------------------------E!
FEFERI: Finally! So Karkat, w)(at was your dream like after you died? I )(ave been glubbing like crazy over )(ere wondering about it.
FEFERI: You look so nervous and pale. Were you scared of w)(at you saw?
FEFERI: T)(ere's no reason to be scared! T)(ey are not as terrible as t)(ey look.
FEFERI: W)(en Derse is destroyed, I am going to go to sleep and prove it.
FEFERI: I will prove it to you, and to t)(em as well.
FEFERI: Our new friends! You'll see. -Everyt)(ing is going to be ok.
FEFERI: T)(IS IS PR-ETTY -EXCITING! Don't you t)(ink???
FEFERI: GLUB TO T)(AT ATTITUD-E!!!!!! >38O 
FEFERI: Glub... I wouldn't say t)(at.
FEFERI: T)(e w)(ole t)(ing doesn't seem like it's wort)( getting worked up about, to be )(onest.
FEFERI: Sig)(. T)(ey're just kind of dull.
FEFERI: Life is dull and uninteresting.
FEFERI: I don't know, maybe I'm just a little depressed.
FEFERI: You probably wouldn't understand.
FEFERI: Pffffffffffffffffff )(-E)(-E)(-E)(-E!
FEFERI: PSYYYYYYC)(-E )(-E-E )(-E-E )(-E-E )(-E-E )(OO )(OO )(OO! 38D
FEFERI: )(oly crap did I get you good! )(ey, Sollux! Did you catc)( any of t)(at?
FEFERI: A live one jumped rig)(t into my boat! A real suckerfis)(! Woo)(oo)(oo. )(ow do you like t)(at, spider)(ag! Sea dwellers represent!!!
FEFERI: T)(anks. I )(ope I didn't jeopardize our friends)(ip wit)( t)(at little stunt! 38)
FEFERI: Terezi, we can't just )(ide )(ere forever! We )(ave to kill t)(e demon!
FEFERI: T)(e )(umans! T)(ey are t)(e answer.
FEFERI: Y-----------ES!!! I am sure of it.
CC: Glub glub. 38) 
CC: S-E-E?? 
CC: I told you! 
CC: T)(ere is not)(ing to worry about at all. 
CC: )(oly mackerel, looks like SOM-EON-E woke up on t)(e wrong side of t)(e absurd )(uman bed! 
CC: C)(ill out, Jade. I am just following up on w)(at I told you earlier. 
CC: About your dream! Your post-dreamdeat)( dreamself's dream. 
CC: Errr. W)(ic)( is a term I just made up now. 38| 
CC: Yes, I imagine not! You )(ave spent your w)(ole life dreaming about prospit, no? 
CC: Yes, Jade. It is time to face t)(e facts! 
CC: Our moons are gone too. If we wis)( to sleep now, our dreams must take place in t)(e bubbles glubbed by t)(e gods w)(o live in t)(e Furt)(est Ring. 
CC: It is t)(e infinite space w)(ic)( divides all sessions, completely unnavigable and unfat)(omable, untouc)(ed by t)(e time or space of any universe in existence. 
CC: Its lords are our slumberbuddies now. 38) 
CC: Don't be ridiculous. T)(ey are not as dreadful as t)(ey look. 
CC: In fact, t)(ey are quite )(elpful if you know )(ow to talk to t)(em! 
CC: Don't you remember our dream? I was trying to s)(ow you t)(at t)(ere is not)(ing to fear. 
CC: But t)(en... you kind of freaked out! )(umans are so M-ELODRAMATIC. 
CC: )(ELL YEA)(! 38D 
CC: GLUUUUB oh fine. 
CC: I will suspend my neato quirk just for you. 
CC: I hereby renounce the royal mark of sea dweller supremacy in the interest of INT-ERSP-ECI-ES DIPLOMACY. 
CC: JEGUS JADE. 
CC: Look! It is like a cool trident I throw sometimes. 
CC: psioooooo ---------------E 
CC: How is that not awesome! 
CC: Okay, you win. I have officially humbled myself before you. Entirely glubbing peasant-IFICATED for your pleasure. 
CC: Shall I clip my fins for you as well, your majesty? 
CC: Well, thank you! On both counts, of being likened to something other than an obnoxious human, as well as on my exotic looks. 
CC: For the record, you look pretty awesomely weird too. 
CC: I introduced myself before, but since you do not remember, I will do so now. My name is Feferi, and I was going to be the Empress, but now I am not! 
CC: Hell if I know! 
CC: In your pre-death dream at least. Oh, well you died obviously, so there's that. 
CC: All I could see was what happened in your hive. 
CC: You were asleep, and then your robot exploded. 
CC: And then your lusus saved you! Kind of like mine saved me. 
CC: Before she died. 38C 
CC: Oh? Who was that? 
CC: Ah, Karkat. Of course. 
CC: Yes, he's our leader. Why did he want you to talk to him? 
CC: Glubshrug. 
CC: He's pretty harmless, really. You get used to his yelling. 
CC: I do not even process it as yelling anymore. More like a lot of blubbering. 
CC: More blubber spills out of that mouth than a gash in a poached whale. 
CC: Gluuuuuub, I just made myself hungry. 380~ 
CC: Hey! We're the aristocracy. We've got a duty to be weird. 
CC: Anyway, go talk to your shoutfriend I guess. 
CC: And hey, if you want to take another nap sometime, let me know! They will be more than happy to glub us up another bubble. 
CC: PSH WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT, MISS HORNLESS MCFINLESS. 
CC: Why, if I'm not mistaken, you are looking a little drowsy right now. We may meet again sooner than you think. 38D 
CC: Glub glub glub glub glub! 
CC: )(ey, take it easy! 
CC: I'm not )(ere to give you a )(ard time like my buddies )(ave been. 
CC: Ok t)(en, you can be t)(e judge of t)(at. I won't be long! 
CC: I've just come to say a couple t)(ings. 
CC: FIRST! 
CC: None of t)(is is really your fault! 
CC: T)(is is swimmingly obvious to everyone )(ere w)(o takes a glubbing moment to t)(ink about it rationally. 
CC: W)(ic)( isn't many of us! But still. 
CC: I mean, your lusus jumped rig)(t in t)(ere to save you! 
CC: Just like mine did. 
CC: Well ok, mine was dead at t)(e time. 38( 
CC: And s)(e just kind of... 
CC: F-ELL IN! 
CC: Kinda drifted down like fis)(food, and POW, GL'BGOLYBSPRIT-E. 
CC: )(e)(e)(e)(e)(e)(e)(. S)(e was so funny. 
CC: It's a big ol' monster custodian you grow up wit)(! 
CC: S)(-E-ES)(, )(ow freaking retarded do you )(ave to be not to know somet)(ing like t)(at? 
CC: I'm joking, of course. 38) 
CC: I wanted to glub somet)(ing -ELS-E to you well before you started playing. 
CC: Just to get t)(e idea in your )(ead! 
CC: I am Feferi, by t)(e way. Abdicated empress to be! 
CC: Soon I will go to sleep and speak to t)(e gods. 
CC: I will convince t)(em to establis)( a series of stable dream bubbles, w)(ere we can meet in our sleep! 
CC: YOU'LL S-E----------E! 38D 
CC: Did I? 
CC: When?? 
CC: )(mm. 
CC: Jade, t)(is is t)(e first time we )(ave ever talked! 
CC: Isn't it??? 
CC: W)(at's t)(at? 
CC: Well, maybe we did! 
CC: )(ey, by t)(e way. 
CC: W)(at exactly are you doing t)(ere wit)( t)(at toy? 
CC: You never did explain it to me! 
CC: Good point. 
CC: Maybe I'm feeling it too. 
CC: I )(ave... w)(at was it? Orca vu? 
CC: 38? 
CC: In the future! Duh. 
CC: Yes, you are asleep. But your dream self died, just like mine, remember? 
CC: Now you don't dream about Prospit. You have normal dreams! 
CC: It is a dream, and a memory. It is the past, brought back to life by a witch! It's all those things. 
CC: Although we are getting off the script here! 
CC: This is not how the conversation originally went, obviously. 
CC: You were a lot less patient with me! When I was just trying to ENCOURAGE you. 
CC: Sure! 
CC: Hey, why don't you tell me about this cool robot bunny you we're making? 
CC: I've been pretty glubbing curious about it! 
CC: Mind if I take a look? 
CC: It's great! 
CC: Wish I could make something like this. Never had the gills for technology. 
CC: Hard to work with under water! 
CC: Nope! 
CC: I woke up from my nap a while ago. 
CC: Remember how I woke up and then messaged you? You had just had a bad dream! 
CC: And I told you there was nothing to be scared of. 
CC: Which there isn't! 
CC: Because, stupid. 
CC: I'M D------EAD! 
FEFERI: Y-ES! W)(y don't you )(op in too, Kanaya? 38D
FEFERI: T)(ere is plenty of space. Sollux and I are glubbing about feelings.
FEFERI: )(-EY, S)(UT YOUR MOP-EY BLOW )(OL-E!!! I was just s)(owing a little bassic courtesea.
FEFERI: Really, you are just t)(e grouc)(iest dude sometimes.
FEFERI: (And it's really cute!)

FEFERI: <3
FEFERI: Kanaya, I see t)(at look on your face.
FEFERI: You are curious, but are nervous about meddling, M I RIT------E?KANAYA: Uhh
FEFERI: It's ok, really! We were s)(aring some feelings about stuff. Sollux was feeling bummed out because Aradia blew up, and s)(e was )(is very close friend.
FEFERI: Yea)(! -Ey, Karcrab, get yer nubs over )(ere! Plenty of room in t)(e pile!
FEFERI: OMG, t)(at was SUC)( an obscene gesture )(e just made. 38O
FEFERI: But I )(ave it on good aut)(ority t)(at s)(e is fine!
FEFERI: Everyt)(ing is going to go swimmingly, YOU'LL S-E-E. 38)
FEFERI: KRABSNACK!!!!!!
FEFERI: You're just in time. We are talking about serious feelings )(ere!
FEFERI: Sollux )(as been feeling...
FEFERI: Oh fine. 38(
FEFERI: So w)(at reeled you over to t)(e old pile?
FEFERI: You are?
FEFERI: Aw, t)(at's so sweet!
FEFERI: Maybe somet)(ing frig)(tened )(im off into t)(e lab?
FEFERI: W)(y don't you go looking for )(im? We could )(elp!
FEFERI: We were t)(inking of taking a nap, actually.
FEFERI: You s)(ould too, Carpcatfis)(! It'll be GR-EAT!
FEFERI: -Eridan, please! I don't want to see any more dueling.
FEFERI: Don't try to provoke )(im. It's not like I don't know w)(at you're doing! You keep trying to spark a rivalry wit)( )(im to get me to auspisticize between you two, and pull us out of our quadrant!
FEFERI: It is t)(e oldest and lamest trick in t)(e book. It didn't work t)(en and it won't work now!
FEFERI: Ok -Eridan, we can talk. But only if you're planning on being civil.
FEFERI: Go wit)( you?? -Eridan, you weren't really serious about going to find Jack, were you?
FEFERI: )(e )(as a point t)(oug)(, in t)(at you may be overestimating your abilities?
FEFERI: Jack Noir is INSAN-ELY powerful -Eridan! Please, I don't want to see you do anyt)(ing foolis)( by trying to fig)(t )(im.
FEFERI: YOU'R-E W)(AT???
FEFERI: NO I AM NOT! And you aren't eit)(er! T)(at is GLUBBING INSAN-E!
FEFERI: I t)(oug)(t you were supposed to be t)(e Prince of )(ope? )(ow is it )(opeful to surrender to a murderous demon like a COWARD???
FEFERI: NO. You )(ave lost ALL RIG)(T to use fis)( puns FOR-EV-ER. I revoke your fis)( punning license, as w)(ale as our fronds)(ip!
FEFERI: W)(AT T)(-E FUCK DID I JUST SAY???
FEFERI: T)(at's it. T)(is makes me sad, -Eridan, but now we )(ave to stop you. We can't let you find Jack and risk you leading )(im to us.
Feferi: GLUB! (whoops, i mean glub. oh gosh, it's my ancestor!)
Feferi: (i'm so nervous, i can't let her notice me. she's so unbubbleivably cool! *swoonami*)
FEFERI: 38)
FEFERI: 38?
FEFERI: 3;)
