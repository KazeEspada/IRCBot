DAVESPRITE: sup
DAVESPRITE: just telling a troll to step off
DAVESPRITE: well i knew a lot anyway
DAVESPRITE: cause im from the future
DAVESPRITE: but yeah i know more stuff now
DAVESPRITE: like things meant specifically for sprites to clue players in on
DAVESPRITE: but packaged in these like
DAVESPRITE: i guess riddles
DAVESPRITE: im supposed to be cagey about it
DAVESPRITE: but i dont really feel like it
DAVESPRITE: ask me anything go ahead ill give you a straight answer
DAVESPRITE: thats the best fucking question anybody ever asked
DAVESPRITE: thats up to him
DAVESPRITE: if he decides to wise up and listen to us
DAVESPRITE: if not then we just bail everyone out yet again
DAVESPRITE: all that gear you picked up should let you breeze through the first couple gates
DAVESPRITE: even at a low level
DAVESPRITE: later youll unlock the ability to bring your sprite down with you
DAVESPRITE: and well take care of shit together
DAVESPRITE: til then i guess just mess around and let jade build up or whatever
DAVESPRITE: ill go kill some time
DAVESPRITE: maybe draw some comics
DAVESPRITE: i dont know
DAVESPRITE: whats the last one you did
DAVESPRITE: oh yeah
DAVESPRITE: i gave up on that half way through
DAVESPRITE: lets do some brainstorming later
DAVESPRITE: blow everyones minds
DAVESPRITE: i know its crazy what kind of foresight this guy has
DAVESPRITE: im telling you coincidences like that are unreal they dont even happen
DAVESPRITE: most of the time
DAVESPRITE: dude our shit is SAFE
DAVESPRITE: gonna sleep pretty sound tonight
DAVESPRITE: with that big fucking payload of safety you just got dropped on us
DAVESPRITE: gonna be all huggin my pillow and shit
DAVESPRITE: grinning like a goddamn bear full of honey
DAVESPRITE: asshole thinks its candy
DAVESPRITE: doesnt even know he just stepped on a security rake and got a face full of fucking safety
DAVESPRITE: alright
DAVESPRITE: hey
DAVESPRITE: oh looks like you got caledfwlch
DAVESPRITE: you found that pretty fast
DAVESPRITE: yeah i guess so
DAVESPRITE: i think its welsh
DAVESPRITE: thats an awesome question
DAVESPRITE: tactically yeah its a downgrade since its what i used to make caledscratch which is obviously way better
DAVESPRITE: caledscratch cycles the sword through its own timeline to points when its broken or nonbroken or old and rusted or recently forged etc
DAVESPRITE: and your snoop snowcone swords probably even better than that so yeah you got options
DAVESPRITE: hahahaha
DAVESPRITE: with unreal air as a mount fit for a true artifact knight
DAVESPRITE: did that shit ever land or what
DAVESPRITE: fuck
DAVESPRITE: top priority make more
DAVESPRITE: thats an order from your celestial fuckin spirit guide
DAVESPRITE: it was stolen
DAVESPRITE: by one of hephaestus's minions
DAVESPRITE: yeah lord of the forge
DAVESPRITE: yeah pretty much
DAVESPRITE: anyway he gets pissed off you broke it
DAVESPRITE: and he wants it back
DAVESPRITE: to do something important with it though not really sure what
DAVESPRITE: hes a pretty ornery dude
DAVESPRITE: kept raving about how he was waiting for the forge to come
DAVESPRITE: which he needs to complete his work
DAVESPRITE: but in my timeline the forge would never come
DAVESPRITE: so he was extra pissed off
DAVESPRITE: volcano
DAVESPRITE: yup
DAVESPRITE: both
DAVESPRITE: theres all sorts of stuff i suddenly knew about the game when i became this orange feathery asshole
DAVESPRITE: i am fuckin filthy with wisdom its sick
DAVESPRITE: i mostly know stuff about your personal quest
DAVESPRITE: what used to be my quest but i guess i got to deal with not being alpha dave no more
DAVESPRITE: shrug
DAVESPRITE: its all good
DAVESPRITE: anyway that sword
DAVESPRITE: its important to getting your shit figured out
DAVESPRITE: you were supposed to break it to get it out of the thing
DAVESPRITE: like another personal sort of mythological milestone you were supposed to clear
DAVESPRITE: well i dont know
DAVESPRITE: maybe if john was to try with his pure heart and shit it woulda popped out like a champagne cork and fuckin hero confetti woulda blasted him in the face
DAVESPRITE: but you
DAVESPRITE: we
DAVESPRITE: we had to break it
DAVESPRITE: theres a lot more i know about your quest
DAVESPRITE: all tangled up in ridiculous riddles and bullshit enigmas
DAVESPRITE: and maybe its all a moot point anyway in this timeline who knows
DAVESPRITE: but i think ill spare you all that crap
DAVESPRITE: cause its kind of boring
DAVESPRITE: and youll find out anyway
DAVESPRITE: oh yeah why
DAVESPRITE: rose beckoning you again
DAVESPRITE: yeah they werent too happy with my reckless indiana jones bullshit either
DAVESPRITE: i got your back dude dont worry
DAVESPRITE: when you wake up
DAVESPRITE: ill probably get going
DAVESPRITE: ill just sort of
DAVESPRITE: release myself
DAVESPRITE: go do my own thing
DAVESPRITE: after this i dont think youll need me
DAVESPRITE: seems like youve got the stable time loop thing figured out already
DAVESPRITE: which means youll be alright
DAVESPRITE: future yous will get you out of trouble
DAVESPRITE: if youre gonna live up to the responsibility of eventually becoming them
DAVESPRITE: and by virtue of loop stability it sort of means you cant technically fuck up anymore
DAVESPRITE: but dont let that idea go to your head itll mess you up
DAVESPRITE: dunno
DAVESPRITE: fly around
DAVESPRITE: up away to the sun like a fucknig piece of gargbage
DAVESPRITE: see if i can catch up with bro maybe
DAVESPRITE: elusive bastard
DAVESPRITE: who knows
DAVESPRITE: i completely lost track of him
DAVESPRITE: in that timeline and this one
DAVESPRITE: the dude is fucking inscrutable we both know that
DAVESPRITE: thanks man
DAVESPRITE: caw caw motherfuckers
DAVESPRITE: hey
DAVESPRITE: been better
DAVESPRITE: what happened to you
DAVESPRITE: oh
DAVESPRITE: i turned into a bird and got in a fight
DAVESPRITE: what this thing
DAVESPRITE: legendary sword
DAVESPRITE: long story
DAVESPRITE: shenanigans mostly
DAVESPRITE: well
DAVESPRITE: basically im from another timeline
DAVESPRITE: we couldnt win the game there so i came back to help dave
DAVESPRITE: dave from this timeline
DAVESPRITE: as a sprite im supposed to help him with his quest
DAVESPRITE: shes doing alright dont worry about it
DAVESPRITE: so things kind of became even more crazy in this timeline than the one i was from
DAVESPRITE: and it was clear dave was never gonna do the quest i didnt get the chance to finish
DAVESPRITE: not even after you brought the forge
DAVESPRITE: your volcano
DAVESPRITE: so
DAVESPRITE: after laying low for a while
DAVESPRITE: i just went and did whatever i could myself
DAVESPRITE: got caledfwlch
DAVESPRITE: the fuckin welsh sword dave broke
DAVESPRITE: went to look for hephaestus again
DAVESPRITE: figuring there wasnt much hope in beating him this time either especially being injured and all but what the hell right
DAVESPRITE: but then
DAVESPRITE: thats when you lit the forge somehow
DAVESPRITE: well no
DAVESPRITE: not you other jade
DAVESPRITE: sounds like you came back because jade made the decision for you
DAVESPRITE: i made the decision to come back myself maybe itd be different if you had the same chance
DAVESPRITE: i think everyones on top of this
DAVESPRITE: theres not much for us to do anymore
DAVESPRITE: i guess so
DAVESPRITE: but not really for me since im not the real dave anymore
DAVESPRITE: thats a bit complicated
DAVESPRITE: see it turns out
DAVESPRITE: i had no idea how the denizens worked at all
DAVESPRITE: i busted into his palace
DAVESPRITE: to finish the quest
DAVESPRITE: i was expecting him to be asleep and was gonna figure out some way to wake him up
DAVESPRITE: but like last time i saw him
DAVESPRITE: he was already awake to greet me
DAVESPRITE: they are
DAVESPRITE: as sprites were programmed to know things like that about the game
DAVESPRITE: but i guess not everything
DAVESPRITE: it seems like if you try to go fight them too soon
DAVESPRITE: you find them awake and theyre like
DAVESPRITE: what the fuck are you doing here already
DAVESPRITE: which is what happened last time i saw him
DAVESPRITE: before i became a sprite
DAVESPRITE: and i stupidly tried to fight him which was a bad idea because hes hella strong
DAVESPRITE: and the whole time he was raving about shit
DAVESPRITE: about a stolen sword and missing forge
DAVESPRITE: but i wasnt really listening
DAVESPRITE: if i had i might have understood
DAVESPRITE: he wasnt actually trying to kill me he was giving me the choice
DAVESPRITE: wait i mean The Choice
DAVESPRITE: i always forget i can talk underlined for important shit
DAVESPRITE: i guess i made an unwitting choice
DAVESPRITE: by deciding to flee
DAVESPRITE: i figured he was unbeatable so i decided to get the fuck out of there
DAVESPRITE: so i snapped a quick captcha to get his huge hammers code and then gtfo
DAVESPRITE: like i said he was awake again
DAVESPRITE: but this time i wasnt in any condition to fight
DAVESPRITE: so i didnt
DAVESPRITE: and thats what i didnt get
DAVESPRITE: hes this terrible angry monstrous guy but theres no need to fight him
DAVESPRITE: so he looked me up and down all hard
DAVESPRITE: saw the broken sword
DAVESPRITE: and like before gave me the choice
DAVESPRITE: yeah
DAVESPRITE: no
DAVESPRITE: it was different
DAVESPRITE: i think it must be always different
DAVESPRITE: depending on the circumstances
DAVESPRITE: i dont know what the choice is when you face him the way youre supposed to
DAVESPRITE: but im showing up as this bleeding bird sprite holding his broken sword
DAVESPRITE: so thats pretty odd situation
DAVESPRITE: he sees i got his sword and its busted and you can tell hes pissed
DAVESPRITE: but like before its like restrained anger
DAVESPRITE: like hes always about to just fucking flip but still keeps it together
DAVESPRITE: so he can tell me
DAVESPRITE: he can repair it
DAVESPRITE: and make the deringer with the forge lit
DAVESPRITE: he says he can repair anything
DAVESPRITE: but only one thing
DAVESPRITE: and i had to choose
DAVESPRITE: so i said ok fix the sword
DAVESPRITE: meh
DAVESPRITE: doesnt matter really
DAVESPRITE: i just thought making the sword felt like the right thing
DAVESPRITE: so i gave him the sword
DAVESPRITE: but it still wasnt all that simple
DAVESPRITE: he needed lava from the forge to make it
DAVESPRITE: which means echidna had to be awake
DAVESPRITE: our denizens had to have some kind of truce to make it happen
DAVESPRITE: see what i mean about it being complicated
DAVESPRITE: so jade must have done something right
DAVESPRITE: to wake her up and get the forge going
DAVESPRITE: dont know what she did though
DAVESPRITE: are you sure
DAVESPRITE: reckoning
DAVESPRITE: its getting close to the end
DAVESPRITE: more meteors are getting by the portals
DAVESPRITE: the battlefield will probably be wiped out soon
DAVESPRITE: would there be a point
DAVESPRITE: yeah me too
DAVESPRITE: what would you want to do
DAVESPRITE: if you werent scared
DAVESPRITE: well
DAVESPRITE: i was going to bring this sword to dave
DAVESPRITE: no
DAVESPRITE: i was gonna say
DAVESPRITE: im not in any shape for more adventuring
DAVESPRITE: i figure this is probably my last stop
DAVESPRITE: but maybe this is a way you can help
DAVESPRITE: if you want
DAVESPRITE: maybe you dont have to actually go anywhere
DAVESPRITE: you oughta have a lot of special powers remember
DAVESPRITE: because of ascending to doghood
DAVESPRITE: try doing your spacey thing
DAVESPRITE: i mean not to sound condescending or anything but its got to be like borderline omnipotence pretty much
DAVESPRITE: just put your mind to it
DAVESPRITE: yeah no shit
DAVESPRITE: let me check it out
DAVESPRITE: maybe ill humorously defile willis and afflecks dumb skyward yearning faces
DAVESPRITE: come on dude hand it over
DAVESPRITE: too late i already did it with sprite powers while he wasnt looking
DAVESPRITE: ahahahaha you fucked up
DAVESPRITE: wake up sleepy head
DAVESPRITE: wait why did i even say that
DAVESPRITE: stay asleep all you want like i give a fuck
DAVESPRITE: but you are kind of missing some important shit here
DAVESPRITE: we spent three faux relativistic years cruising through the metaphysical asscrack of nowhere
DAVESPRITE: and when we finally get here youre all tuckered out
DAVESPRITE: like yall didnt sleep enough on this boat already
DAVESPRITE: some of the sicknastiest shuteye anyone ever got i owe to this friggin boat
DAVESPRITE: dude this is a big deal everyones waiting for us out there
DAVESPRITE: i mean...
DAVESPRITE: probably
DAVESPRITE: i dont know where we are some green hilly place with all these stone henges sprinkled around
DAVESPRITE: did you know there could be a plurality of stone henges i didnt but guess fucking what
DAVESPRITE: henges APLENTY where this place is concerned
DAVESPRITE: hey wheres jade
DAVESPRITE: i guess she left already?
DAVESPRITE: maybe there was an emergency somewhere and her doggy senses led her there
DAVESPRITE: maybe someone fell down a well
DAVESPRITE: what do you think john do you think our teen parents fell down a well
DAVESPRITE: nah i sincerely doubt that any of them would be that pathetic
DAVESPRITE: whatever it was it must have been important enough for jade to ditch us like this
DAVESPRITE: either that or
DAVESPRITE: maybe she was that desperate to finally get away from me
DAVESPRITE: between you and me john
DAVESPRITE: i didnt really handle things with her as well as i could have
DAVESPRITE: oh well maybe real dave will treat her better
DAVESPRITE: or not i dont know
DAVESPRITE: i did her a favor cutting bird dave out of her life
DAVESPRITE: nobody really deserves bird dave as a boyfriend or a friend or anything its like getting one of the janky daves from the bargain bin at the dave depot
DAVESPRITE: or one of the marked down daves the day after national dave day
DAVESPRITE: its like somebody taxedermized your dave and expected you not to notice
DAVESPRITE: "feathers what feathers haha no that dave is totally normal and ok"
DAVESPRITE: you should just go back to being bros with real dave when you see him
DAVESPRITE: ill be fine ill just flap around and do my thing alone
DAVESPRITE: im completely alright with that at this point
DAVESPRITE: we had our ups and downs john but all in all it was cool to go on this road trip with you
DAVESPRITE: there were some times man
DAVESPRITE: the times
DAVESPRITE: im telling you they were unreal
DAVESPRITE: i bet you people would pay good money to see every second of the madcap stunts that were going down on this ship basically 24/7
DAVESPRITE: if hulls could talk wow
DAVESPRITE: haha just joking it was seriously boring as hell
DAVESPRITE: but i mean it was still cool so yeah
DAVESPRITE: hey
DAVESPRITE: whats that ring anyway
DAVESPRITE: ive seen you with that ring before and i guess i was just like
DAVESPRITE: ok john has a magic ring for some reason
DAVESPRITE: no need to mention that or anything
DAVESPRITE: but where did you even get it
DAVESPRITE: you cant even hear me you got your snooze on so hard
DAVESPRITE: aint gonna wake you up to hassle you about no ring
DAVESPRITE: i probably should have said all this stuff when you were awake anyway
DAVESPRITE: like the stuff about friendship
DAVESPRITE: fuck it ill just leave another one of my patented magic notes taped to your shoe or your cowlick or something
DAVESPRITE: my magic notes rule ill miss leavin em taped on stuff
DAVESPRITE: i sure do talk to myself a lot dont i
DAVESPRITE: wow why have i never made this observation
DAVESPRITE: i probably needed to be a bird for exactly three years to finally have that epiphany
DAVESPRITE: i wonder if real dave ever had that epiphany
DAVESPRITE: probably not cause hes not a bird
DAVESPRITE: the bottom line is being a guy whos also a bird makes you think
DAVESPRITE: anyway im out
DAVESPRITE: p.s. happy birthday john
DAVESPRITE: have some watermarks for the road
