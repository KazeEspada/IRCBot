GA: Why Is It That When The Subject Of Temporal Mechanics Is Broached Your Sparing Human Intellects Instantly Assume The Most Ingratiating Posture Of Surrender Imaginable
GA: Time Is Not That Difficult To Understand
GA: It Is A Utility That A Universe May Resort To In Order To Advance A Desired Degree Of Complexity
GA: Or May Not Resort To If That Is The Case
GA: Its All Pretty Pedestrian
GA: But No 
GA: When Time Travel Comes Up You Present The Face That A Man Shows When The Breeze Gradually Alerts Him To His Absence Of Netherdressings
GA: I Dont See How We Are To Properly Agitate You All If You Continue To Insist On Failing To Understand Basic Concepts Which Common Infants Effortlessly Manage To Describe Via Scrawlings In Their Own Puddles Of Sloppy Discharge
GA: Yes 
GA: In The Future
GA: Oh My It Is Your Human Sarcasm Again
GA: I Enjoy Listening To It And I Wish Doing So Could Serve As My Primary Form Of Recreation
GA: There See I Just Did It Too
GA: Saying The Opposite Thing To Emphasize My Contempt
GA: But Suddenly I Feel More Primitive And Hate Myself A Little More
GA: It Was Like This Funny Miracle That Just Happened In My Heart
GA: Oh Dear
GA: No We Arent From "The Future"
GA: But We Are All Already In Agreement That You Dont Get It And Never Will
GA: We Did
GA: Your Future
GA: For Me It Was Only A Couple Minutes Ago
GA: Yes Thats Right
GA: Will You Try To Talk Some Sense Into Your Idiot Friends
GA: So That We May Proceed To Bother Them All On More Rational Terms
GA: I Will Admit This Campaign Of Provocation Wasnt All That Well Thought Out
GA: Dont Tell Anyone I Said That
GA: Yeah Maybe
GA: Why Dont We Be Friends
GA: I Think So
GA: I Think Were Supposed To
GA: You Suggested As Much Earlier
GA: Yes A Couple Minutes Ago
GA: Thats Likely
GA: You Command The Seer
GA: So You May Have Some Insight Into Her Disposition
GA: The One Who Is A Little Snooty 
GA: Thats An Exotic Title
GA: I Thought You Were The Knight
GA: Have You Found Her Demeanor To Be Chilly
GA: On A Basis Of Personal Interaction That Hypothetically Extends Beyond The Context Of A Short Lived And Lackluster Trolling Effort
GA: I Thought Your Familiarity With Her May Allow You To Furnish Me Insight
GA: She And You Are Familiar Isnt That Right
GA: She Perhaps Even Regards You With Uh
GA: Endearment
GA: Um Is This
GA: A Common Sort Of Practice In Human Courtship
GA: Watching Oblong Meat Products Tumble Into Places They Dont Belong
GA: Am I Being Accused Of Falling Prey To The Human Dysfunction Of Amorous Inclination
GA: I Just Would Like To Gather
GA: Some Means Of Gauging Her Sincerity
GA: Maddening
GA: How Do Humans Forge Meaningful Relationships Using Such Communication Patterns
GA: Perhaps It Is The Human Riddle That Is Truly The Ultimate Riddle
GA: It Was Not A Sincere Remark
GA: I Have Been Practicing
GA: Your Human Sarcasm
GA: Very Well
GA: I Am Beginning To Feel As Though I Am The Only One Working On Our Friendship
GA: That Was Sincerity
GA: Then
GA: Keep Saying The Opposite Things
GA: It Sounds Like
GA: You Are Advising Me To Troll Her Again
GA: Which I Have Tried
GA: It Proved To Be A Fruitless Endeavor
GA: Okay
GA: I Believe I Understand How To Proceed
GA: Your Dark Spectacled Friend Has Advised Me On A More Effective Method For Trolling You
GA: I Think His Contention Is That This Strategy Will Have The Opposite Of The Intended Effect And Precipitate A Sort Of Bond Between Us That Is Established In Mutual Antagonism
GA: What Do You Think About This
GA: Ah See It Is Working Already
GA: Ive Listened To His Advice
GA: And Have Resolved To Modify The Approach Slightly
GA: I Know What I Have To Do
GA: What We Have To Do Really
GA: Remember The First Time We Spoke
GA: The First Time You Spoke To Me Was The Second Time I Spoke To You
GA: This Is Your Second Conversation With Me But Is My Seventh With You
GA: Thats Next Time
GA: Yes And The Rest Of The Sequence Is Simply
GA: 4=3, 5=4, 6=5, 7=6
GA: Unless My Future Self Stowed Another Conversation In Between One Of Those Which Is Entirely Possible
GA: But Urrgh I Dont Want To Think About That
GA: See That Is What I Mean Rose You Are Not As Dumb Of A Girl As I Was Initially Lead To Believe
GA: Yes
GA: That Is Why I Have Contacted You Now
GA: I Will Send You A Copy Our First Conversation Directly From My Chat Log
GA: Yes And Then I Found It Sort Of Curious That During My Next Conversation With You Your Various Mental Endowments And Wherewithals Were Not As They Seemed
GA: I Suspected The Stratagem Might Be A Counter Trolling Measure But Then Was Not So Sure And Further Examination Grew Warrant
GA: But See I Have Edited The Copy Already In Ways That Will Remain Secret For Now But You Will Discover Once You Type It
GA: So You Are Destined To Edit It No Matter What And What You Submit Will Be What I Once Read Regardless
GA: !
GA: Yes Unless I Lied About Editing It In The First Place
GA: Either Way Through Knowledge Of What You Will Say I Have Precisely Engineered The Nature Of Your Transgression
GA: !!!
GA: Yes
GA: Yes I Suppose Its That Sarcasm All The Time Seems Laborious To Me
GA: Yes And The Providence Of This Antagonism Ninja Vice Grip Pinching Your Larynx Has Already Begun To Supply My Purpose With Fruit
GA: The Chilly Frost Shimmering On Our Tree Of Human Friendship Has Begun To Thaw
GA: Dave Raised Insight Into The Human Psychology Of Friendship Development
GA: By Allotting You Your Side Of The Conversation I Have You At The Disadvantage In Your View And You Will Seek To Reclaim Higher Ground
GA: In Successive Conversations
GA: 4=3 And 5=4 And Such
GA: Your Demeanor Will Be Terse If Not Saturated With Disdain And It Will Cause Me To Be Confused And Question Your Motivation
GA: But Now I Know Your Motivation Because I Am Supplying It Here And Now
GA: They Will Be Simple Acts Of Friendly Human Retaliation
GA: Yes
GA: It Seems Friendship For Some Humans Is A Basic Aggregation Of Shallow And Insincere Hostilities
GA: I Dont Understand
GA: Who Better To Coordinate Such Events Than The Knight Of Time
GA: I'm Hopping To 8=8
GA: Ideally You Will Have Long Since Discarded This Train Of Thought
GA: Im Supposed To Antagonize A Few Members Of Your Trivial Species
GA: I Have To Start Somewhere
GA: And Somewhen
GA: So I Am Starting With You
GA: And Now
GA: Its Going To Be Pointless And Unpleasant
GA: Mostly For Me
GA: Actually You Know What
GA: Im Not Really Feeling This At All
GA: Goodbye
GA: Is This
GA: Your Human Sarcasm That Ive Heard About
GA: That You Always Use
GA: And That Is Basically A Terrible Way To Communicate
GA: I Thought That Was The Thing You Did
GA: The Rose Human Specifically
GA: Okay These Are Definitely Insincere Statements
GA: Why Do You Work So Hard At Being So Awful
GA: Have We Spoken Before
GA: Now That I Think About It It Is Pretty Conceivable That I Will Talk To You Again In The Past After This Conversation
GA: I Should Figure Out How The Viewport Feature Of This Application Works
GA: So I Can See What Such A Primitive Creature Looks Like
GA: Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest
GA: It Seems You Put Stock In Johns Assessment Of Things
GA: Even Really Uninteresting Things That Are Pretty Terrible To Listen To
GA: He Is Either The Leader Of Your Party Or You Hold Whatever The Human Equivalent Of Mating Fondness For Him Is
GA: Uh Okay
GA: Okay Human Courtship Is Definitely A Strange Thing And Its Sort Of Blowing My Mind Listening To This
GA: I Think Ill Talk To Someone Else Now
GA: Maybe
GA: When Along His Timeline Would You Recommend Communicating With Him
GA: Considering That Youre Obviously Not That Smart
GA: And Basically Understand Whipping Bugwinged Fuckall About Even The Most Elementary Temporal Mechanics
GA: I Am A Bit Perplexed As To Why I Find Myself So Vehemently Fondling The Short End Of The Antagonism Stick Here
GA: Kind Of Irritating
GA: Im Going To Talk To Your Comrades
GA: This John Human
GA: And Figure Out Whats Going On
GA: Consider Me Fully Briefed On The Matter.
GA: Until Next Time Rose
GA: Next Time In The Past
GA: If Youre Not Too Busy Still Setting Up The Network
GA: Perhaps You Could Come Show Me How To Activate The Viewport
GA: My Keyboard Is Missing The F1 Key
GA: You Used To Like To Talk More
GA: If I Recall I Was Typically The One Who Would Solicit Reprieves From Your Nonsense
GA: So I Dont Know What Happened
GA: Then Why Are You Doing This
GA: Setting Up These Stations For Us
GA: I Did Fiddle With It
GA: To No Avail
GA: Hello Again
GA: Are We Friends Yet At This Point In Time
GA: I Would Speculate That If We Are Not By Now Then It Is Probably Not To Be
GA: Furthermore Which Rose Have You Chosen To Be This Time
GA: The Stupid Rose Or The Smart Rose
GA: It Sounds Like You Are Attempting To Be The Smart Rose This Time
GA: Please Take Note Of The Subtle Scorn Underlying The Selection Of The Word Attempting
GA: Smart Rose Should Get A Kick Out Of That
GA: Smart Rose Is All About Subtle Scorn Isnt She
GA: Whereas Dumb Rose Doesn't Capitalize Letters Even When Discussing The Proper Names Of Human Monsters In Earth Cinema
GA: I Think You Should Establish A Greater Commitment To A Single Roleplaying Scenario
GA: I Suddenly Dont Understand Anything
GA: What Are You Talking About
GA: I Believe I Understand
GA: It Was I Who Did Something To Provoke Your Scorn In A Previous Conversation
GA: One Which I Have Not Had Yet
GA: Fine
GA: Hi Again Aradia
GA: So I Guess Tonight Is The Night You Blow Everything Up
GA: Is There Nothing I Can Do To Change Your Mind
GA: Yeah I Guess Not
GA: I Thought Id Be Friendly Though
GA: And Remind You That You Do In Fact Have A Hand In All The Terrible Things That Are About To Happen
GA: Because Thats What Friends Are For
GA: And The Fact That What Ensues Will Be Terrible
GA: Is An Immutable Fact I Am Stating For The Record
GA: And The Fact That We Will Not Be On The Same Team Is Similarly Immutable
GA: It Does Not Mean That Teamwork Is What Isnt Taking Place Here
GA: Ill Be Here To Help
GA: If You Need Me
GA: Just Wanted To Know
GA: Is Your Lusus Dead Yet
GA: Uh No
GA: You Sure Do Seem To Be Saying Cahoots
GA: Im Just Asking
GA: Because Mines Dead
GA: It Was Just Her Time
GA: No There Was No Plot Or Conspiracy Or Any Trace Of Saboteurs Operating Through The Special And Magical Union One Can Only Describe As Being In Cahoots With Another
GA: When A Virgin Mother Grub Abdicates And Renounces Brooding
GA: Her Time Will Be Relatively Short
GA: I Always Knew This
GA: Maybe You Still Can
GA: They Are All Dying
GA: Or Are Going To Soon
GA: I Believe Its A Preemptive Consequence Of The Game We Are About To Play
GA: If A Preemptive Consequence Is A Concept That Can Be Said To Hold Any Meaning
GA: But From What I Understand If It Is Applicable In Any Sphere At All Then This Game Holds That Sphere
GA: I Wasnt Going To Think That
GA: You Know What I Dont Think Even I Really Understand What I Just Said So Nevermind
GA: Yes A Few
GA: Karkat Thinks Its His Fault
GA: He Believes His Actions Triggered An Inauspicious Chain Reaction
GA: Sure
GA: Im Not Surprised To See You Endorse His Paranoia Without Hesitation
GA: But I Was Attempting To Illustrate A Point In Bringing It Up
GA: These Events Are Inevitable And Regardless Of Whatever Emotional Entanglements Obfuscate Their Significance They Will Ultimately Serve An Important Purpose
GA: The Curse Had Nothing To Do With It
GA: And Karkats Notion Of A Curse Is Inseparable From His Perception Of Events As Intrinsically Negative And As Tailored To His Personal Dissatisfaction
GA: And Your Bad Luck Is The Same Way
GA: I Believe Anyway
GA: What Would Happen If You Just Cleaned Up A Bit
GA: Dont You Think You Would Step On A Few Less Hard Triangles
GA: Because Youre Dangerous
GA: Every Time You Tell Me To Can It I Think Its Funny
GA: I Mean Its Just A Funny Thing To Say Dont You Think
GA: Its Ok To Be Dangerous
GA: Lots Of People Are
GA: And Dangerous People Can Be Really Important
GA: Maybe Even The Most Important Sometimes
GA: But It Just Means Theres Got To Be Someone Around To Keep An Eye On Them
GA: And If Not Me Then Who
GA: Everyone Has An Important Job To Do
GA: That Wouldnt Work
GA: If I Tried To Stop You You Would Regard Me As An Enemy
GA: Instead Of Merely As A Nuisance
GA: And What Good Would That Do
GA: So Im Afraid Mcfussyfangs It Must Be
GA: Youre Right Anything Can Happen I Guess
GA: But Just So You Know Im Sorry For Your Loss In Advance
GA: Hey
GA: You Seem More Excited Than Usual
GA: Or Less
GA: I Cant Tell
GA: Help Me Tell Without Saying Glub
GA: Im Going To Type This Face Now
GA: :?
GA: Even Though No One Knows How To Make A Mouth Do A Question Shape Like That
GA: Yes You Can
GA: But Thats Fine You Can Glub To The Content Of Your Collapsing And Expanding Bladder Based Aquatic Vascular System
GA: If It Means You Are Excited About Something
GA: Ok Why
GA: It Looks Like One Of Your Letters Got Away From You
GA: You Forked An Innocent D Loitering Over There By The Shout Pole Minding Its Own Business
GA: Yeah Sure
GA: I Thought So
GA: I Have Been Cloaked In A Mood Of Perpetual Anticipation For Some Time As Well
GA: Well
GA: Not Really
GA: What Notes Would You Like To Submit For Comparison
GA: Yeah
GA: I Dont Know For A Fact That She Is Mine
GA: I Know
GA: But What If I Dont Really Want Her To Be That
GA: Yeah Glub Glub Shrug Is The Right Attitude I Think
GA: Our Minds Are Already Made Up Anyway Arent They
GA: They Dont Tell Me Everything
GA: Just As I Am Sure She Doesnt Whisper Everything To You
GA: I Wonder If Any Other Kid On The Planet Has As Many Burdens In The Fire As You
GA: I Doubt It
GA: Just Wanted To Know
GA: Is Your Lusus Dead Yet
GA: Who
GA: Overstating Our Relationship Wont Make Me Feel Very Cooperative
GA: Its Paler Red Than That Ok
GA: Why Do I Got To
GA: I Dont Got To And Every Time You Take My Help For Granted I Feel Like I Got To A Little Less
GA: If Your Slander Werent So Predictable Id Block You Too For Saying That
GA: Has It Occurred To You She May Have Blocked You Because You Are Vvery Ovverbearing
GA: I Just Said That Aloud Now In Your Silly Accent And Had A Private Moment Of Enjoyment
GA: Your Black Solicitation Just Seems Really Indecent
GA: What Do You Want From Her Anyway
GA: What Is It
GA: Can You Just For A Moment Entertain The Thoughts Of One Untouched By Megalomaniacal Derangement And Tell Me Why Id Want To Assist You With That
GA: Also Speculate For A Moment That Self Preservation Might Not Be What Would Sway My Decision
GA: Its Just
GA: Laborious Listening To This
GA: Im Sorry
GA: None Of It Matters
GA: I Know
GA: But You Really Should Know By Now The World Will End Tonight Regardless
GA: Land And Sea Dwellers Alike Will All Die
GA: Because Of The Game We Are About To Play
GA: And I Agree The Fate Of The Race Is Important But Its In My Hands Now
GA: All Of Ours Really
GA: Really
GA: The Doomsday Scenario In Particular
GA: No Not Exactly
GA: I Have Another Source
GA: No
GA: You Arent Actually On The Same Team
GA: No Thats Not It
GA: Its Unbelievable
GA: Her Patience
GA: Never Mind
GA: Something About Longing To Touch You Indiscretely
GA: And That Shes Basically In The Scarlet Throes For You
GA: As Deep In The Flushed Quadrant As One Can Be
GA: To The Letter
GA: Absolutely Not
GA: Yeah
GA: Shes Just A Concerned Moirail
GA: Looking Out For You
GA: Thats All
GA: What Do You Mean
GA: Oh
GA: Hmm
GA: What
GA: Just Presenting A Floating Reminder That Tavros Will Need Plenty Of Inclined Surfaces For His Ascent
GA: Hes Reported Otherwise
GA: Maybe I Should Upend This Load Gaper Over Your Head
GA: Im Still Learning The Interface
GA: It Could Happen Accidentally At Any Moment
GA: Think Of Another Way To Help
GA: Ok
GA: Hmm
GA: I Thought I Was
GA: Okay This Will Probably Strike You As An Odd Moment For Me To Mention This
GA: But Actually
GA: There Are Not Many Moments Ive Observed On Your Timeline Which Wouldnt Qualify As Odd
GA: And Somehow
GA: Your Idle Moments Seem To Invite Interruption The Least
GA: And This Is A Difficult Topic For Me To Broach
GA: For Reasons That You Probably Wont Understand
GA: Okay Sorry
GA: Ive Just Been Meaning To Say
GA: That I Read Your Instructional Guide
GA: Your Speech Was Really
GA: Emotional
GA: I Dont Mean To Critique Your Speech
GA: I Just Wanted To Ask You Something In Confidence
GA: About The Humans
GA: Are You Sure Theyre Responsible For Our Misfortune
GA: Was It On Account Of Malice Or Incompetence
GA: It Sort Of Does
GA: Im Not Even That Sure Why
GA: This Is A Difficult Topic For Me To Broach
GA: For Reasons That You Probably Wont Understand
GA: Will Your Response Involve An Athletic Maneuver Of Some Sort
GA: Um
GA: What
GA: Really
GA: Weird
GA: It Is Pretty Disheartening
GA: But
GA: You Are Absolutely Sure They Are All Failures
GA: And That They Have No Chance Of Succeeding
GA: Im Not Sure Which Depresses Me More
GA: The Sabotage Of Our Session Or The Futility Of Theirs
GA: Well I Havent Asked What I Wanted To Ask
GA: Its About TentacleTherapist
GA: You Have Notes On Them
GA: I Guess
GA: Thats Why Youre Our Leader Karkat
GA: Statements Like That Are Also Why Youre Our Leader
GA: Have You Talked To Her
GA: The Rose Human
GA: Also
GA: Do We Really Have To Say Things Like The Rose Human
GA: Uh Okay
GA: It Just
GA: Feels Really Silly When We Say Things Like The John Human In Confidence Amongst Ourselves
GA: The Speech Has Become Emblazoned On My Think Pan
GA: Virtually Ensconced In The Fold Of My Personal Mythology
GA: I Dont Know
GA: Im Not Sure If Ive Got It In Me Right Now
GA: Fine
GA: A Report About What
GA: Is There A Metric For That Concept
GA: That Seems Just As Disparaging To Me As It Is To Her
GA: Hello
GA: Allow Me To Make This Simple
GA: I Am A Troll From Another Universe Using A Chat Client Utility Which Is Capable Of Contacting You And Your Friends At Any Point Of Your Lives Which I Choose Up To And Including The Moment Of Your Own Incompetence Fueled Self Destruction
GA: Im Looking For Evidence Of Intelligence In Your Species
GA: A Reason
GA: Any Reason At All Really
GA: To Justify Wasting The Few Precious Remaining Moments Of My Life On You
GA: It Has Fallen On Your Shoulders To Supply Me With That Reason John Human
GA: Go
GA: What Indeed
GA: I Was Just Leaving
GA: No
GA: We Dont Actually Travel Through
GA: Uh
GA: Well
GA: Not All Of Us Do
GA: One Of Us Does Though
GA: Thats Not What We Are Talking About Here And Is Aside From The Point
GA: No
GA: No John You Werent Listening
GA: Damn It
GA: What The Hell
GA: Okay Youre Even Dumber Than The Rose Human Thats Incredible Really
GA: Im A Girl Not A Boy
GA: It Happens
GA: Yes As A Matter Of Fact
GA: If You Werent So Stupid Id Suspect You Were Being Insincere For The Benefit Of Your Amusement
GA: I Just Spoke To Her In The Future
GA: Shes An Imbecile And Conveying How Much I Dislike Her At This Point Presents An Overwhelming Gauntlet Of Personal Expression
GA: But Regardless She Said To Paste Something From Our Conversation
GA: To Get You To Understand Whats Going On
GA: I Have Strong Doubts It Will Be Effective But Here Goes
GA: GA: I Should Figure Out How The Viewport Feature Of This Application Works
GA: GA: So I Can See What Such A Primitive Creature Looks Like
GA: TT: haha, well i know what you guys look like.
GA: TT: you look kind of like... 
GA: TT: howie mandel from little monsters. 
GA: TT: even though, to be perfectly frank, he was kind of a big monster. 
GA: TT: because he was a big goofy adult. 
GA: TT: and fred savage was like his child prankster sidekick.
GA: GA: Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest 
GA: TT: no, it's a movie. 
GA: TT: you should ask john about it, because he thinks it's awesome, which it is. 
GA: Are You Suggesting
GA: I Was Being Trolled
GA: That It Was A Charade Meant To Make Me Look Foolish
GA: Now Im Wondering If You Might Be Trolling Me As Well
GA: Okay
GA: Suspicions Pitching Once Again Toward The Conclusion That You Are Just Very Stupid
GA: Im Guessing Thats The Human Equivalent Of 12th Perigees Eve
GA: Will Your Adult Human Custodian Forage For Leavings As Ours Do
GA: Your Blocks Mean Nothing But Dont Worry You Wont Hear From Me Again
GA: What
GA: The Hell
GA: Did You Just Do
GA: You Actually Did It
GA: Blew It Up I Mean
GA: I Had Begun To Believe That Was Embellishment
GA: What Is It
GA: Yeah
GA: Really
GA: What Questions Do You Have
GA: Okay This Will Probably Strike You As An Odd Moment For Me To Mention This
GA: But Actually
GA: There Are Not Many Moments Ive Observed On Your Timeline Which Wouldnt Qualify As Odd
GA: And Somehow
GA: Your Idle Moments Seem To Invite Interruption The Least
GA: And This Is A Difficult Topic For Me To Broach
GA: For Reasons That You Probably Wont Understand
GA: Okay Sorry
GA: Ive Just Been Meaning To Say
GA: That I Read Your Instructional Guide
GA: Yeah
GA: Why
GA: Lately
GA: Almost Perpetually
GA: Wow Yeah Kind Of
GA: Also
GA: That One
GA: Actually
GA: At The Time Of Reading It Lent Some Useful Insight
GA: Into The Nature Of The Game I Hadnt Yet Considered
GA: And
GA: The Author I Guess
GA: Uh
GA: By The Way
GA: What Are You Doing Here
GA: Is This Part Of Your Ongoing Investigation
GA: Are These Tactics Really Necessary
GA: I Know
GA: But I Thought Our Methods Earlier Were Effective
GA: In Illuminating The Underpinnings Of The Game
GA: You Ask Some Questions
GA: And I Answer
GA: If I Can
GA: No
GA: Okay
GA: But These Means Presently On Display
GA: Are Making Me A Little Nervous
GA: I Think Its Kind Of A Reckless Use Of
GA: These Forces
GA: Yes
GA: Well
GA: Influence By The Gods From The Furthest Ring
GA: The Communion You Seem To Have Developed With Them I Find Kind Of Troubling
GA: How Exactly Do You Know That
GA: How Much Time Have You Really Spent Sleeping
GA: Since You Began Playing
GA: That Makes Me No Less Nervous
GA: Our Understanding Is That Influence From Doomed Timelines
GA: Though Seemingly Necessary To Advance In The Alpha Reality
GA: Is Generally Inauspicious
GA: Travelers From Such Branches Are Marked For Death
GA: And Though It Was Only An Insubstantial Part Of You Which Traveled
GA: Just Memories I Suppose
GA: Its Still Troubling
GA: Actually
GA: I Havent
GA: I Have Never Visited Derse Or Traveled Beyond The Veil
GA: Prospits Moon Was My Home
GA: For Most Of My Dreaming Life
GA: Yes
GA: Why
GA: Skaia Was Always The Foil For My Curiosity
GA: But It Only Showed Me What I Needed To See
GA: It Very Much Had The Presence Of Something Sentient
GA: And
GA: Benevolent
GA: But Silent
GA: Not Something To Converse With Or Be Instructed By
GA: Or Anything With An Agenda Beyond Which It Knows To Be Manifest Already
GA: Like A Very Clear Mirror
GA: That Has Everything There Is To See Inside It
GA: But Only Some Things Are Visible At Any Given Moment
GA: I Always Trusted It
GA: And I Dont Trust Gods That Would Eschew Its Light
GA: Oh
GA: A While Ago
GA: I Have To Confess That
GA: Ive Been Experiencing Something Like
GA: Impression Whiplash
GA: Since That Time
GA: At First I Thought You Were Foolish And Incompetent
GA: You See Thats What Im Talking About
GA: That Was A Very Snarky Remark That Happened Just Now
GA: Stratified By Your Signature Varieties Of Insincerity Which Cut Through The Literal Meaning Of The Statement Like Colorful Ribbons
GA: And The Net Intent Is Something Maddening To Try To Know
GA: Its Meaning I Think Exists At The Inscrutable Nexus Of Semantic Space Where Humor Chafes Against Soft Malice
GA: A Place Perhaps The Human Mind Occupies More Comfortably I Dont Know
GA: Xenopsychology Isnt My Strong Suit
GA: Or Even A Real Word
GA: Uh Yeah I Know Im Babbling Again
GA: The Point Is Its Not The Type Of Behavior A Very Stupid Person Can Perpetrate
GA: And So My Impression Has Thrashed Around From Conversation To Conversation
GA: And Now
GA: Rather Than Suspecting You Of Incompetence
GA: I Have Begun To Fear Just The Opposite
GA: I Think You Might Be Dangerous
GA: Maybe Not Knowing That Is What Really Bothers Me
GA: Why Dont You Put The Turtle Ruins Down
GA: And Return To Your House
GA: I Have Sketched Some New Outfits For You That I Think Are Nice
GA: We Could Try To Make Them
GA: It Will Be Fun
GA: Urrgh No
GA: Sadly
GA: What If There Isnt A Later
GA: I Mean
GA: There Not Being A Later Might Happen Sooner Than You Think
GA: I Mean
GA: For You Specifically
GA: Okay
GA: This Was Something Else I Wanted To Say
GA: Or Ask About
GA: But Im Afraid My Asking Might Play A Role In The Outcome
GA: And I Dont Know If I Want That
GA: Um
GA: Alright
GA: I Cant See You In The Future
GA: The Viewport Wont Let Me After A Certain Point
GA: Its Black
GA: But Only For You
GA: Not The Others
GA: Several Hours From Now
GA: Do You Know Why This Could Be
GA: Sort Of
GA: But It Remains Ominous
GA: Also Sort Of
GA: Wait
GA: Is That What Im Doing
GA: On Second Thought
GA: Thats Not What I Want To Do
GA: Well
GA: I Hope That Doesnt Happen
GA: But Id Rather Not Get Stuck In That Kind Of Pattern Again
GA: So If You Want To Wreck Turtle Villages And Tear Your Planet Apart On The Counsel Of Dark Gods
GA: Fine With Me I Guess
GA: Ur
GA: Ill Do The Thing You Do When You Dont Say Anything
GA: "..."
GA: What Was Your Question
GA: I Believe Youre Owed Some Compensatory Ignorance
GA: Ive Never Heard Of It
GA: Agreed
KANAYA: Vaguely
KANAYA: Impromptutations
KANAYA: I Did My Best To Clean Up The Blood Before You Woke Up
KANAYA: Dont Worry I Dont Really Want To Find Out What Happens If I Do
KANAYA: Any Other Orders
KANAYA: Such As Those Which Might Pertain To These Alien Children
KANAYA: How Are Those Orders
KANAYA: They Are Not Irrelevant
KANAYA: Its A Bit Complicated
KANAYA: But I Believe You Should Give Them A Closer Look Before You Decide What To Do About Them If Anything
KANAYA: Perhaps Then An Especially Leaderly Speech Will Be In Order
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: What Do You Want
KANAYA: Oh Sorry I Hadnt Really Noticed
KANAYA: Do You Want Me To
KANAYA: Whats There Really To Catch Up On
KANAYA: Okay
KANAYA: What
KANAYA: Did He Really Go For You
KANAYA: Thats Not How I Remember It
KANAYA: Could You Leave Me Alone
KANAYA: I Said Leave
KANAYA: What
KANAYA: Is That What Im Doing
KANAYA: Hmm
KANAYA: I Guess I Find Her Sort Of
KANAYA: Intoxicating
KANAYA: Intoxicatingly Underwhelming
KANAYA: Hey Have You Ever Heard Of The Green Sun?
KANAYA: I See
KANAYA: Anything More Specific Than That
GA: Since The Gap Between Your Present Moment And The Implementation Of Your Mystifying Self Destruction Continues To Narrow
GA: This Will Be The Last Conversation In Which I Attempt To Talk You Out Of It Nicely
GA: First Of All Youre Underestimating The Gravity Of A Dream Death
GA: Its A Pretty Serious Thing Okay
GA: And Dream Selves Are Important To A Person In Ways That Arent Always Obvious
GA: I Think Youre Being Frivolous But Thats Not Really The Sentiment Reinforcing The Exoskeleton Of My Argument
GA: Soon You Will Be Blacked Out Of Trollians Viewport
GA: And I Have No Explanation For This
GA: And Neither Do You
GA: So Ill Just Assume The Worst And You Should Too
GA: Ive Seen You Sleep Before
GA: You Are Just
GA: Asleep
GA: On Screen
GA: Peaceful And Harmless And Posing No Threat To Anyone
GA: Unless I Guess You Are Up To Mischief In Your Dreams Which I Cannot Rule Out
GA: Actually Thats Probably What You Do In Your Sleep What Was I Thinking
GA: Uh
GA: What
GA: Right Sorry
GA: Im Saying This Is A Special Case
GA: It Is Foreboding And Disconcerting And You Are Being Reckless
GA: Your Hubris Is Really Astonishing
GA: Easily Twice The Mass Of A Universe I Think
GA: That It Hasnt Collapsed Upon Itself Into A Tiny Lavender Singularity Is The Most Striking Marvel Paradox Space Has Coughed Up Yet
GA: No Please Stop
GA: Humor Wont Deflect My Really Big And Important Tirade Okay
GA: You Are Investing Too Much Confidence In Evil Gods Who Oppose Skaia And Your True Purpose And
GA: I Cant Abide That
GA: And
GA: As Difficult As This Is For Me To Confess
GA: I Think Your Plan Is Very Dangerous
GA: And So Are You
GA: Yes
GA: And
GA: Im Afraid I Am Going To Have To Devote All My Efforts To Stopping You
GA: Im So Glad You Asked
GA: You See
GA: I Have Been Training A Powerful Wizard
GA: Yes Your Shout Pole Is Like A Tower Broadcasting Your Fear Across The Ring And You Are Right To Be Afraid
GA: I Have Commissioned None Other Than The Legendary Prince Of Hope And I Am Teaching Him The Ways Of White Sorcery
GA: I Have Observed Your Methods And You Will Come To The Most Unwelcome Realization That All Of Your Guile And Cunning Has Finally Backfired
GA: This Noble Magician Of Pure Light Will Serve As The Counterpoint To Your Arcane Debauchery
GA: He Will Hunt You Down And Goodness And Hope Will Prevail
GA: Yes Its Much Too Late For That
GA: Oh Yes I Do Believe Securing A Corpse Box Would Be Prudent
GA: Fitted To Dimensions Suited To Your Myriad Of Unassembled Leaky Body Parts In Aggregate
GA: Yes Definitely
GA: Definitely Do That
GA: Wait I Hope That Wasnt Too Emphatic
GA: Maybe At This Point I Should Clarify This Is All A Big Joke
GA: I Was
GA: Okay Great
GA: I Think What I Find Most Challenging About Human Insincerity Based Humor Is The Degree Of Commitment To The Fantasy Which Is Apparently Requisite
GA: I Mean To Say
GA: The Gesture Of Hostility In This Case Was The Joke
GA: I Did In Fact "Train" This Character
GA: I Made Him A Wand To Shut Him Up
GA: He Wouldnt Stop Harassing Me For Your "Secrets"
GA: Hes The One With The Royalty Complex And Speaks With All The Extra Vees And Doubleyous
GA: Okay
GA: Okay I Will
GA: Uh
GA: Yeah That
GA: Is Still Something That I Dont Really Want To Joke About
GA: I Hope That Came Across As A Sincere Statement
GA: Are You Feeling Any More Cooperative In This Timeframe
GA: I See No Of Course Not
GA: Please
GA: I Know You Were Talking To Her Shortly Before
GA: What Did You Say To Her
GA: Wow
GA: I Still Dont Understand The Password Thing
GA: Past You Doesnt Care About Passwords What Happened
GA: Which Is Favorable
GA: Can We Discuss A Serious Issue In A Silly Manner
GA: How Am I Supposed To Know The Password
GA: I Dont Remember That
GA: I Feel Like I Am Trudging Waist Deep Through A Slither Basin Full Of Your Human Surprise Noodles
GA: I Understand This Silliness Is Currently Permissible But Are Serious Questions About The Password Nonsense Permissible As Well
GA: Why Are You Demanding Passwords From Me And Also Apparently Karkat
GA: I Am Not Trying To Do That
GA: When Will I Get The Password
GA: Im Appreciating Our Conversations From This Timeframe More And More
GA: Past You Is Much Less Of A Taskmaster Than Future You Or Pre Blackout Rose
GA: I Mean Post Blackout Rose Is A Lot Less Difficult Insofar As She Is Unavailable
GA: I Guess Youll Find Out Soon
GA: And Then Report It To Me Under Extremely Specific Circumstances
GA: Which Is Good Because I Sure Dont Know
GA: Yes Hmm And That Face Is A Good Response
GA: Your Eyes Are Right To Be Swirled Letters
GA: What Are You Doing
GA: I See
GA: Well I Didnt Actually Tell You To I Was Just Being Informative
GA: Also It Isnt Technically Witch Of Spacey Stuff
GA: I Was A Sylph Not A Witch
GA: I Think Its Sort Of Like A Witch
GA: But More Magical
GA: Yes Im Completely Certain Of That Suddenly
GA: But Regardless I Think Our Roles Are Approximately The Same Since We Are Both Stokers Of The Forge
GA: As Well As Holders Of Breeding Duties
GA: However I Should Clarify That My Earlier Counsel Was Mostly Academic
GA: It Takes Weeks To Do All Of It Properly
GA: You Wont Have Time
GA: Yeah
GA: What Does It Sound Like
GA: Well It Does
GA: But Not Breeding Through Means Typical Of Most Species
GA: It Has A Lot To Do With It
GA: It Is Cloning Equipment Much Like What Is Scattered All Over The Veil
GA: The Same Kind Responsible For Creating All Of Us
GA: I Didnt Mean To Alarm You By Implying You Were Required To Wage A Great Deal Of Personal Procreation Over A Span Of Several Weeks
GA: Though It Should Be Clear That Repopulation Is Among Our Duties As Well In The Long Term
GA: And Ive Gathered That The Cloning Apparatus In The Veil Is Probably Meant To Permit An Initial Boost On The World We Select For Settlement
GA: But Beyond That It Is Up To The Descendants To Perpetuate The Race
GA: And Your Species Has Quite An Advantage In This Respect
GA: Your Procreation May Be Carried Out By Paired Individuals Autonomously
GA: Whereas Ours May Not
GA: Which Is What Makes My Role Particularly Important
GA: Im The Keeper Of The Matriorb
GA: It Is An Egg That Will Hatch A New Mother Grub
GA: She Alone Will Be Responsible For Bearing Our Young
GA: I Guess So
GA: And You Are Like Erect Livestock
GA: Without The Muscle Definition
GA: Or The Hermaphroditic Physiology For That Matter
GA: But Milk Producers Nonetheless
GA: That Rare Kind Of Organism To Nurture Hatchless Young Within
GA: Are You Not
GA: Anyway
GA: I Had Imagined I Would Hatch The New Grub On A Planet In Your Universe
GA: And When That Became Impossible I Quickly Lost Hope
GA: I Assumed It Would Remain Locked In Its Card Forever
GA: Which Could Only Be Opened When The Orb Was Meant To Be Used
GA: But Then I Found Something Quite Unexpected When I Was Exploring This Lab
GA: I Found A Key
GA: It Was Deep In The Meteor
GA: And As I Suspected It Released The Orb
GA: Which Was Really Confusing To Me For A While
GA: Until I Realized What It Meant
GA: Which Is So Obvious Im Amazed I Didnt Think Of It Right Away
GA: It Means I Am Supposed To Use It Now
GA: To Hatch The Grub In The Heart Of This Meteor
GA: Sure
GA: There Is No Reason A Meteor Couldnt Act As The Center Of Our Races Resurrection
GA: They Are Themselves Like Large Seeds After All
GA: The Only Question Is Whether We Can Manage To Keep It From Being Destroyed
GA: As Well As Whether I Am Able To Raise A Mother Grub To Maturity
GA: Oh Wow That Thought Is Actually Pretty Overwhelming
GA: You Do
GA: Yes She Was In Fact A Mother Grub
GA: Who Relinquished Her Calling As Matriarch To Raise Me
GA: Okay
GA: Thanks For Saying So
GA: Its Very Involved 
GA: Like I Said You Wont Have Time 
GA: In Fact It Probably Should Have Taken Considerably Longer Than It Took Me 
GA: I Was A Little Rushed 
GA: Yes Youre Right 
GA: I Cant Imagine How You Can Complete The Objective In The Time Given 
GA: But Weirder Things Have Happened I Think 
GA: First Deploy The Pad 
GA: Um 
GA: Why All The Way Up There 
GA: Yes Thats Right 
GA: That Will Probably Change If You Light The Forge 
GA: But One Thing At A Time I Guess 
GA: Thats The Appropriate Size For The Equipment 
GA: Babies 
GA: What 
GA: Yes I Know 
GA: I Didnt Mean To Suggest Your Breeding Duties Involved Cloning Humans 
GA: Repopulation Is Not Whats Happening Here 
GA: Its Not Your Objective As The Witch Of Space 
GA: Not Yet Anyway 
GA: Frogs 
GA: Sorry I Thought That Was Obvious 
GA: Yes 
GA: What Are You Laughing At There 
GA: What Is He Saying 
GA: Hmm
GA: Okay Im Laughing Pretty Hard At All That
GA: He Will Need To Deploy The Terminal
GA: Then You Can Start Hunting For Frogs To Appearify From Around Your World
GA: I Would Conjecture That Most Of Them Are
GA: And Will Stay That Way Until The Forge Is Brought To Life
GA: I Think The Event Is Designed To Trigger Drastic Planetary Upheaval Wherever The Forge Is Stationed
GA: It Did On My Planet As Well
GA: No Mostly Water
GA: Yes
GA: It Probably Wont Do Any Good But You Can Try
GA: The Problem Isnt That The Frog Is Still Frozen
GA: The Problem Is That You Were Able To Appearify It At All
GA: Ectobiology Is Based Entirely On Your Inability To Appearify A Subject
GA: If That Frog Were Destined To Do Something Else
GA: Such As Become Ensnared In Your Net Later
GA: You Would Not Be Able To Appearify It Because That Would Cause A Paradox
GA: So Instead You Would Appearify Its Slime Imprint
GA: The Paradox Slime Is What Is Important Here
GA: You Can Mix It With The Slime From Other Paradoxically Appearified Frog Imprints
GA: Study The Genes And Selectively Combine
GA: And Then Create Resulting Paradox Clones
GA: You Will Need To Direct The Terminal To Another Frog
GA: And Then You Must Be Sure Later To Interfere With That Frog In Some Way
GA: For Instance By Planning To Venture Out To Capture That Exact Frog As I Suggested Earlier
GA: That Way It Will Be Impossible To Appearify The Frog Before Your Interference Has Taken Place
GA: Only Its Slime Will Arrive
GA: Yes
GA: Yes That Should Work
GA: Make A Note Of The Coordinates
GA: When You Travel To Interact With Your Cloned Subjects You Are Also Taking The Opportunity To Explore And Discover New Habitats
GA: As Well As New Species Of Frogs For Your Terminal To Track
GA: Its Efficient To Go Adventuring In This Fashion While You Are Waiting For Your Young Clones To Mature
GA: Yes Its A Lot Of Fun
GA: It Is Also Extremely Time Consuming
GA: Unlike Some Appearifiers In The Veil This One Is Locked To The Present Moment
GA: You Cannot Use It As A Window Into The Future Or Past And Isolate Frogs Whose Futures Are Certain And Therefore Most Paradoxifiable
GA: Means Of Expedition Are Limited
GA: I Suppose You Could Use Time Travel To Accelerate The Process
GA: But You Would Need To Establish Weeks Worth Of Stable Time Loops
GA: I Think It Would Be An Overly Elaborate And Dangerous Undertaking Personally And Anyone Who Would Attempt Such A Thing Is Reckless
GA: I Wouldnt Advise It
GA: Youll Need Somewhere To Keep Them While They Grow
GA: Like A Pool Or A Tank Or Such
GA: Or At Least Something Temporary
GA: Water Wasnt Very Hard For Me To Come By But For You I Dont Know
GA: Yes But This Isnt All There Is To The Cloning Process
GA: A True Paradox Clone Is An Exact Genetic Duplicate Of The Subject
GA: Later That Clone Will Be Sent Back In Time To Become Itself
GA: In Fact If It Is An Exact Duplicate This Is Guaranteed To Happen
GA: This Is What Classifies It As A Paradox Clone
GA: Any Duplicate Which Genetically Deviates From The Original Is Not
GA: It Is Simply A Mutant
GA: And For Breeding Purposes Mutation Is Desirable
GA: Within Reason
GA: You May Adjust The Settings On The Equipment To Promote Genetic Anomalies
GA: But Its Very Delicate And You Can Go Too Far
GA: Responsibly Guiding The Evolution Of The Genetic Code During The Breeding Process Is Very Important
GA: In Fact It Is The Most Important Thing About This Of All
GA: Yes
GA: Actually
GA: Yes
GA: Thats Exactly What Youre Doing
GA: Your Objective Is To Breed The Genesis Frog
GA: You Cant Complete The Game Without Doing So
GA: Your Entire Mission Depends On Breeding Him
GA: Yes
GA: He Will Begin As A Tadpole Like You Have There But Considerably Bigger
GA: And He Will Mature To Become The Speaker
GA: A Deity Like Figure Idolized By The Consorts Who Wait For Him To Come
GA: Hes Known As The Speaker Of The Vast Croak
GA: Yes The Croak Really Is Quite Vast And Is Something To Behold
GA: Its The Most Amazing Thing I Have Seen
GA: Yes There Will Be One For Every Session Should The Players Be Successful
GA: And Each One Is A Unique Product Of Their Quest
GA: The Kingdoms Are At Odds Over His Creation
GA: Prospit Worships Him Much As The Consorts Do
GA: Derse Reviles Him And Outlaws Frogs Wherever They Can
GA: Even The Iconography
GA: Their Agents Mock His Name With Slurs
GA: Like Speaker Of The Vast Joke
GA: Or Bilious Slick
GA: Although To Be Honest That Is What We Ended Up Calling Him
GA: Not To Be Disrespectful Though It Was Just A Catchier Name
GA: I Doubt Its Even Possible To Offend Him
GA: Most Certainly
GA: No
GA: Youre Not Really Understanding The Magnitude Of His Role
GA: He Is Not Responsible For Just One Aspect Of The Universe You Create
GA: Hes Responsible For All Of Them
GA: Bilious Slick Is Your Universe
GA: I Dont Mean Hes The Universe You Are From
GA: We Engineered That Incarnation
GA: He Is The Universe That You Are Trying To Create
GA: Sorry
GA: I Thought It Was Obvious But Then Wasnt Sure
GA: Yes Literally
GA: That Statement Was As Literal As You Can Possibly Make Words Be
GA: I Know Your Species Is Frequently Insincere For A Variety Of Reasons
GA: Thats True But When We Do It Its Usually Just Because We Are Trying To Be Jerks
GA: Rather Than By Way Of A Mild Manner Perpetually Dispatching Little Puzzles Of Rhetoric Without Apparent Purpose
GA: Yeah I Think Ive Been Discerning That
GA: Its A Nice Change Of Pace
GA: Oh Its Not Important
GA: Well
GA: Not That It Wasnt An Enjoyable Exercise In Xenocultural Inculcation
GA: Sort Of
GA: I Guess As Mutually Friendly As The Time Has Permitted Two People To Be
GA: I Wont Be Speaking To Her Anymore Though
GA: It Just Means In A Few Moments From Your Perspective I Wont Be Able To See Her Through My Viewport Or Talk To Her
GA: I Dont Know Why Exactly But Its Not That Hard To Guess
GA: She Has Been Relying On The Powers And Counsel Of Dark Gods And Other Sources Of Ambiguous Intent
GA: And She Has Consequently Devised A Plan Which Sounds Very Dangerous To Me
GA: You Are More Sensible
GA: Its Probably The Influence Skaia Has Had On You
GA: Having Spent Much Of Your Life Awake On Prospit
GA: Like Me
GA: If Were Alike In Some Ways Maybe Its Because Of This
GA: I Woke Up A Long Time Ago
GA: I Had Trouble Sleeping When I Was Young
GA: The Sunlight Was Unnaturally Invigorating To Me I Guess
GA: My Lusus Could Do Nothing To Help
GA: And When I Was Supposed To Be In My Cocoon I Would Often Wander Out To The Desert
GA: Where One Day I Was Visited By A Stranger Who Dressed And Spoke In White
GA: He Put Me To Sleep And I Awoke On Prospit
GA: Where I Have Dreamed Ever Since
GA: He Said He Was My Guardian
GA: And Though He Visited Rarely I Did Regard Him As That
GA: Then Later He Stopped Coming
GA: In Time I Began To Believe He Was A Figment Of My Mind
GA: Like An Imaginary Friend To Give Me Reassurance When I Needed It
GA: But Then While Playing Our Game I Learned He Was Real
GA: He Had Spoken To Others From Our Party
GA: And Had Been Manipulating Us All To Advance His Schemes
GA: It Was Saddening To Learn My Fortuitous Awakening Had Been The Product Of A Nefarious Ploy
GA: Youre Lucky That Your Awakening Probably Had No Such Entanglements
GA: But I Guess Its Only A Minor Contamination Of Something Otherwise Great
GA: I Was Allowed To See What Skaia Would Show Me
GA: And To Prepare For Dangers Ahead And Try To Protect People
GA: Youre Right We Do
GA: I Feel A Bit Silly That It Took Me So Long To Engage With The One Corresponding Closely With My Role
GA: It Must Be A Certain Madness Im Afflicted By
GA: To Orbit Those More Reckless And Dangerous Than I And More Daring For It
GA: I Guess I Want To Help Them But They Never Can Be Helped It Seems
GA: Yes Definitely
GA: We Have Our Share Of Dangerous Players Who Seem To Do Nothing But Cause Problems
GA: I Believe She Is Yours
GA: And If Her Insane Plan Wasnt Alarming Enough
GA: She Has Been Communicating With The Stranger I Mentioned
GA: And Unsurprisingly She Has Not Been Forthright About The Nature Of Their Conversations
GA: Yes
GA: And Hes Not Merely A Guardian
GA: Im Very Sure He Is A First Guardian
GA: Like Your Lusus Was
GA: I Feel The Same Way About It
GA: The Involvement Of Any Such Entity Strikes Me As Quite Inauspicious
GA: Even When Seemingly Benign
GA: She Was
GA: Youll Have A Chance To Determine More Soon
GA: After Which Hopefully You Can Tell Me
GA: In The Meantime I Will Go
GA: I Would Like To Return To The Core To Situate This Orb
GA: It Seems You Have Your Own Orb To Care For Now
GA: Okay I Will Definitely Help You As Much As I Can
GA: The Young Prospit Wakers Ought To Stick Together
GA: Ill Message You Again In Your Future
GA: And You May Reply If You Have Cause To
GA: Does It By Any Chance Have To Do With Passwords
GA: Yes You
GA: You Delivered News Of The System By Demanding A Password From Me
GA: Thats A Reasonable Attitude
GA: Okay
GA: Ten
GA: Im Counting Eleven
GA: The Password System Is Already Paying Overwhelming Dividends Of Ease And Rationality
GA: Oh
GA: Wow Yeah
GA: I Hope Im Not Falling Prey To A Crisis Of Sincerity
GA: Oh No
GA: Yeah I Know
GA: Yes Ill Do That
GA: Bye Jade
KANAYA: Relaxing In The Horn Pile I See
KANAYA: That Sounds Nice
KANAYA: But It Really Doesnt Look Like There Is Much Room In That Pile Of Horns At All And I Should Get Going Anyway
KANAYA: Um
KANAYA: Okay I Will Leave You Be
KANAYA: What Was That About
KANAYA: Maybe You Should Go Say Something To Her
KANAYA: Squirreling
KANAYA: Well I Think The Chests Are Fun They Make For Nice SurprisesKARKAT: WHATEVER
KANAYA: If I See Her Along My Way Ill Let Her Know You Want To TalkKANAYA: If You Dont Think Thats Too Meddlesome Of Me
KANAYA: Im Returning To The Core To Deposit The Matriorb
KANAYA: Wish Me Luck
KANAYA: Ill Only Be Gone For A Few Minutes
KANAYA: Anyway Youre Doing A Good Job And I Think You Can Manage To Cope With My Momentary Absense
KANAYA: Thanks
KANAYA: It Sounds Like Youve Been Talking To The Jade Human Like You Said You Would
KANAYA: I Just Used The Phrase The Jade Human Satirically For No Reason It Is Just One Of Many Ways In Which Im Becoming More Multicultural
KANAYA: Have You Found Her Password System To Be Practical
KANAYA: It Sounds Like You Like Her
KANAYA: Well She Is Giving You A Reason To Be Frustrated And Loud What More Could You Ask For In A Friend
KANAYA: Shes Quite Considerate Actually
KANAYA: Do You Think Terezi Is Aware Of Your Interactions With Her
KANAYA: I Dont Want To Sound Too Meddlesome Because I Know People Dont Like That Much But Didnt You And She Used To Have A Thing Like That
KANAYA: Well Didnt You
KANAYA: Maybe She Thinks You Are Trying To Make Her Jealous
KANAYA: Do You Actually Believe She Was Pretending
KANAYA: Maybe You Should Try Not To Be So Quick To Dismiss The Sincerity Of Peoples Emotions
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: I Wasnt Actually Crying Just Now I Was Exaggerating My Reaction For Effect
KANAYA: For WhatERIDAN: for all that trainin you did
KANAYA: But I Didnt Even Really Train You I Just Made You A Wand
KANAYA: Okay Then Youre Welcome
KANAYA: I Hope You Use Your Magnificent Powers Of Light And Hope For Goodness And Purity And Lets Not Forget Science
KANAYA: Uh Oh I Hope That Didnt Come Off As Too Sarcastic
KANAYA: The Thing I Just Said
KANAYA: I Didnt Even Realize How Sarcastic I Was Being Its Starting To Become A Problem I Think
KANAYA: Please Dont Take Too Much Offense
KANAYA: Um Sure
KANAYA: A Little Later Maybe
KANAYA: The Matriorb
KANAYA: I Was About To Go Hatch It In The Core To Restore Our Race
KANAYA: I Hope Its Hopeful
KANAYA: But
KANAYA: Fine
GA: WHAT THE FUCK?
GA: WHO ARE YOU, AND WHY ARE YOU MESSAGING ME THROUGH KANAYA'S ACCOUNT?
GA: I SERIOUSLY DON'T NEED THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW.
GA: Oh Really
GA: This Is A Dream Isnt It
GA: It Seemed Obvious
GA: Either Im Sleeping Or Im Dead Which Is It
GA: My New Self
GA: You Mean
GA: Being A Ghost And Then A Frog And Then A Robot And Then A Fairy
GA: Kind Of
GA: What Do You Mean We Have Been Groomed
GA: Okay
GA: What Do I Do
GA: Was What We Were Attempting Before Not Old Fashioned
GA: It Seems To Me The Nature Of The Afterlife Is Probably Very Old Fashioned
GA: Maybe Even The Most Old Fashioned A Thing Can Get
GA: Yes Then
GA: This Was When You Were About To Give Me That Unusual Gift From The Ruins
GA: Yeah Im Still Not Sure Aradia Are We Supposed To Be Role Playing
GA: Hi Jade
GA: Uh
GA: What Is That Thing Youre Wearing
GA: No I Didnt Mean To Sound Disapproving
GA: But I Do Think More Colorful Apparel Suits You Better
GA: I Did
GA: About What
GA: Whats A Vampire
GA: There Isnt Much To Say
GA: I Repaired The Doll And Made Him A Nice Outfit
GA: With A Far More Becoming Palette And Fit Than The Absurd Tatters He Was Found In
GA: I Thought At Least
GA: Uh
GA: Should There Be Anything Else To This Story
GA: Anyway That Is All I Can Remember
GA: I Quickly Began To Find The Doll Unnerving So I Put Him Away
GA: To My Knowledge He Has Remained Secure In My Block Ever Since
GA: Is He Relevant In Some Way
GA: Yes Aradia It Seems You Have Some Foreknowledge Of This Narrative Maybe You Can Tell Us Why Any Of This Is Important
Kanaya: gamzee ♣  karkat
KANAYA: Actually I Was Just Thinking
KANAYA: Its Nice To Get A Little Sun After So Long
KANAYA: One Moment
KANAYA: Okay Then What Do We Do
KANAYA: I See
KANAYA: Then Perhaps We Should Reserve The Infinite Darkness Plan For The Maybe Column For Now
KANAYA: I Think Im Even Willing To Let Dave Take A Crack At The Logistics Before We Commit To That Particular Maneuver Daring Though It Sounds
KANAYA: Yes Im Willing To Humor Elaboration On This Rap Centric Plan And Its Apathy Based Contingencies
KANAYA: Even If Its Excessively Stupid
KANAYA: So
KANAYA: You Arent Coming Then
KANAYA: Maybe I Will Stay Here Too
KANAYA: As Nice As It Sounds To Move On
KANAYA: I Dont Know If I Can Stand Three Of Your Human Years Of More Darkness
KANAYA: I Like This Sun Its Comforting In A Strange Way
KANAYA: Like Home
KANAYA: What Could I Possibly Do
KANAYA: Aside From Providing A Light Source As You Navigate The Dim Corridors
KANAYA: I Would Function As A Premium Escort To The Load Gaper And Thats About It
KANAYA: What Are You Talking About
KANAYA: What Real Hope Is There For That
KANAYA: The Orb Was Destroyed
KANAYA: I Was Never Able To Duplicate It The Grist Cost Was Astronomical
KANAYA: Doesnt Rose Know
KANAYA: Cant You See The Path To Victory On This Matter
KANAYA: I Would Like To Have The Orb Again And To Keep It Safe This Time
KANAYA: And I Guess To Not Be A Total Failure
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: Well
KANAYA: All Right
KANAYA: But Must We Really Leave So Soon
KANAYA: Wait Another Visitor
KANAYA: Who
KANAYA: He Took Them
KANAYA: Look At The Trails
KANAYA: Im Pretty Sure He Kisses Them Too Sometimes
KANAYA: Clown Hunting
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: No
KANAYA: Have You Seen Gamzee
KANAYA: Yeah
KANAYA: I Know
KANAYA: I Wouldnt Expect Him To
KANAYA: I Wouldnt Even Ask It Would Be Really Bad Form To Ask Him That
KANAYA: Okay
KANAYA: Hmm
KANAYA: Im Being Cool About It
KANAYA: Its Not Like That
KANAYA: I Just Want To Find Him
KANAYA: And
KANAYA: At Least Wound Him Somewhat
KANAYA: No
KANAYA: See Im Explaining This Badly
KANAYA: All Im Saying Is Basically
KANAYA: Just
KANAYA: Fuck That Guy
KANAYA: No Thank You
KANAYA: I Really Wouldnt Rule It Out
KANAYA: What Are You People Even Talking About
KANAYA: I Feel As Though This Conversation Has Utterly Outmaneuvered My Constructive Involvement
KANAYA: Im Going To Go
KANAYA: Augh
KANAYA: Why Does That Always Happen
KANAYA: (Whats Liquor)
KANAYA: (What Are We Talking About Here)
KANAYA: (Oh A Soporific Human Substance)
KANAYA: (Got It)
KANAYA: (I Honestly Have No Idea Whats Going On So I Came Over Here To See If You Knew)
KANAYA: The Deal With The Maryam Looking Girl Is That She Is Wondering What The Deal Is With The Peixes Looking Girl And Specifically Why The Former Has Piqued The Latters Curiosity
KANAYA: The Same Thing Occurred To Me
KANAYA: The Same Thing Occurred To Me Yet Again
KANAYA: I Suppose
KANAYA: To My Knowledge Yes
KANAYA: Is There An Alternative Degree Of Auto Luminescence I Should Be Aware Of
KANAYA: And If So How Foolish Should I Feel For Only Learning About It Now
KANAYA: Really
KANAYA: I Dont Think So
KANAYA: Id Like To
KANAYA: But I Cant Get Up The Nerve
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: She Is An Amazing Person
KANAYA: And It Is Very Intimidating
KANAYA: I Had The Same Feelings Of Trepidation The Last Time I Encountered Someone I Admired
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: Maybe
KANAYA: I Was About To Respond Favorably
KANAYA: But Then I Glanced Over At Rose
KANAYA: And She Was Just Shaking Her Head At Me Very Slowly And Kind Of Knowingly
KANAYA: Oh Probably
KANAYA: But Lets Be Realistic Here The Answer Was Probably Going To Be No Anyway
KANAYA: I Bet It Tastes Really Bad
KANAYA: The Deal With The Maryam Looking Girl Is That She Is Wondering What The Deal Is With The Peixes Looking Girl And Specifically Why The Former Has Piqued The Latters Curiosity
KANAYA: The Same Thing Occurred To Me
KANAYA: The Same Thing Occurred To Me Yet Again
KANAYA: I Suppose
KANAYA: To My Knowledge Yes
KANAYA: Is There An Alternative Degree Of Auto Luminescence I Should Be Aware Of
KANAYA: And If So How Foolish Should I Feel For Only Learning About It Now
KANAYA: Really
KANAYA: I Dont Think So
KANAYA: Id Like To
KANAYA: But I Cant Get Up The Nerve
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: She Is An Amazing Person
KANAYA: And It Is Very Intimidating
KANAYA: I Had The Same Feelings Of Trepidation The Last Time I Encountered Someone I Admired
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: Maybe
KANAYA: I Was About To Respond Favorably
KANAYA: But Then I Glanced Over At Rose
KANAYA: And She Was Just Shaking Her Head At Me Very Slowly And Kind Of Knowingly
KANAYA: Oh Probably
KANAYA: But Lets Be Realistic Here The Answer Was Probably Going To Be No Anyway
KANAYA: I Bet It Tastes Really Bad
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: (shes making me slightly uncomfortable)
KANAYA: Yes I Surely Will
KANAYA: And Im Happy Too
KANAYA: About
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: Okay Thank You
KANAYA: Nothing I Was Just Leaving
KANAYA: Pardon Me
KANAYA: No
KANAYA: Are You Actually
KANAYA: Well I Was Going In There Anyway
KANAYA: I Wont Give You My Password But You Can Follow Me I Guess
KANAYA: But You Can Only Remain As Long As Im Escorting You
KANAYA: Because I Dont Trust You
KANAYA: Youre Right With A Sales Pitch Like That I Would Have To Be An Imbecile Not To Crave Your Company
KANAYA: I Think Youre Probably A Sociopath
KANAYA: Ive Given Enough Of My Time To Such Characters In The Past
KANAYA: My Name Is Kanaya!
KANAYA: 
KANAYA: Whatever Youre Thinking Dont Even Try It
KANAYA: Lets Keep Moving
KANAYA: What
KANAYA: Oh Right
KANAYA: I Became So Absorbed In A Conversation With My Ancestor I Already Forgot She Taught Me How To
KANAYA: Switch Off
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: Very Well
KANAYA: She Is Very Nice And As A Person Is As Impressive As I Was Imagining Her To Be
KANAYA: But Not Nearly As Intimidating Really
KANAYA: Many Things
KANAYA: Primarily Encouraging Me To Pursue My Prior Obligation To My People
KANAYA: She Said She Used To Eschew Her Role Rather Vehemently
KANAYA: The Duties Of Our Caste Were Quite Limiting In Both Worlds It Seems
KANAYA: So She Renounced Them Completely And Wanted A Different Life
KANAYA: But She Also Said Something To The Effect That
KANAYA: She Found That It Wasnt Really Necessary To Reject That Role Completely
KANAYA: And The Same Is True For Me
KANAYA: As Long As I Know Within That I Am Free
KANAYA: And If My Decision Is To Embrace My Path Then It Can Be A Source Of Strength
KANAYA: Its True Theres No Orb Anymore
KANAYA: She Said It May Be Very Difficult
KANAYA: But Theres No Hope If I Dont Try
KANAYA: I Dont Know How Im Going To Do It Yet
KANAYA: But Such Is The Nature Of Adventures
KANAYA: You Cant Be Scared Of Adventures
KANAYA: I Think Im Excited About It Now
KANAYA: I Hope So
KANAYA: Oh No I Can Flip It Back On
KANAYA: See
KANAYA: Turns Out Its Just
KANAYA: A Silly Biological Parlor Trick
KANAYA: Sorry
KANAYA: I Know How You Enjoy A Good Source Of Light
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: Hence The Ghost Who Is Following Me
KANAYA: She Is Exhibiting Her Best Behavior While On This Tour
KANAYA: Shes Actually Doing Very Well So Far
KANAYA: Shh!
KANAYA: So What Were You Just Mumbling Over Here Before I Interrupted You
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: I Know What Your Raps Are Theyre Basically The Same As The Ancient Artform Of Alternian Slam Poetry
KANAYA: But More Primitive And Generally Involving Less Lyrics About Towering Muscular Livestock
KANAYA: I Dont Know I Dont Really Have Much Interest In The Subject
KANAYA: Well There You Go
KANAYA: Um
KANAYA: If You Are Successful In Extracting Blood From The Geological Material In Question Can I Have It
KANAYA: I Dont Know How Sincere Youre Being Dave
KANAYA: Probably Only Somewhat Since The Rule Is That Everything Has To Be At Least Partially A Joke Right
KANAYA: But If You Actually Want To Converse And Exchange Views On Our Respective Cultures Then Okay I Guess Thats Fine
KANAYA: I Might Be Able To Dig Up Some Classic Texts By Some Famous Slam Poets
KANAYA: Ok I Will See What I Can Do
KANAYA: Heh Sure
KANAYA: Oh
KANAYA: Is It Too Late To Back Out Of This
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: By The Tenor Of The Question Ill Assume More Than You Would Prefer
KANAYA: I Wasnt
KANAYA: I Was Just Standing Here And You Slowly Wandered Over In A Totally Oblivious Stupor
KANAYA: You Were Mumbling Your Rhymes And Walked Right Up To Me And Did Not Notice Me Until Now
KANAYA: They Then Proceeded To Have One Of The Most Ambiguously Rated Rap Offs In The History Of Paradox Space While I Stood By And Regarded It Neutrally
KANAYA: I Dont Know
KANAYA: What Do You Think
KANAYA: I Could Go Either Way
KANAYA: Ill Probably Switch On If Im Walking Through A Dark Corridor
KANAYA: Now That I Think About It
KANAYA: Its Been A Long Time Since I Could Even Be In The Dark
KANAYA: Maybe Ill Leave It Off For A While And Refamiliarize Myself With The Experience Of Nonillumination
KANAYA: Um
KANAYA: No Thats Ok
KANAYA: Im Told Its A Trait Confined To Those Of My Caste
KANAYA: They Tended To Spend A Lot Of Time In The Brooding Caverns Where A Convenient Source Of Light Was Often Handy
KANAYA: That Part Of It Makes Sense To Me But I Have No Idea What The Evolutionary Purpose Was For The Sort Of Thirst Which Accompanies This Perk
KANAYA: Strikes Me As An Odd Liability But What Do I Know
KANAYA: Maybe
KANAYA: Or Perhaps It Was A Measured Defect Imposed On Us
KANAYA: To Keep The Auxiliatrices On A Short Leash
KANAYA: The Condition Was Often Glamorized In Certain Works Of Literature
KANAYA: But Theres Really Nothing That Great About It
KANAYA: Not Nearly As Useful As Other Abilities Like The Psychic Gifts Which Some Lowbloods Are Predisposed To
KANAYA: Though I Guess Its Pretty Useful If You Want To Keep The Plans You Made After Someone Punches A Hole Through Your Gut
KANAYA: Not Really
KANAYA: Sure
KANAYA: Anything In Particular That You Have In Mind
KANAYA: Yeah That Sounds Okay
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: (shes making me slightly uncomfortable)
KANAYA: Yes I Surely Will
KANAYA: And Im Happy Too
KANAYA: About
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: Okay Thank You
KANAYA: Nothing I Was Just Leaving
KANAYA: Pardon Me
KANAYA: No
KANAYA: Are You Actually
KANAYA: Well I Was Going In There Anyway
KANAYA: I Wont Give You My Password But You Can Follow Me I Guess
KANAYA: But You Can Only Remain As Long As Im Escorting You
KANAYA: Because I Dont Trust You
KANAYA: Youre Right With A Sales Pitch Like That I Would Have To Be An Imbecile Not To Crave Your Company
KANAYA: I Think Youre Probably A Sociopath
KANAYA: Ive Given Enough Of My Time To Such Characters In The Past
KANAYA: My Name Is Kanaya!
KANAYA: 
KANAYA: Whatever Youre Thinking Dont Even Try It
KANAYA: Lets Keep Moving
KANAYA: What
KANAYA: Oh Right
KANAYA: I Became So Absorbed In A Conversation With My Ancestor I Already Forgot She Taught Me How To
KANAYA: Switch Off
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: Very Well
KANAYA: She Is Very Nice And As A Person Is As Impressive As I Was Imagining Her To Be
KANAYA: But Not Nearly As Intimidating Really
KANAYA: Many Things
KANAYA: Primarily Encouraging Me To Pursue My Prior Obligation To My People
KANAYA: She Said She Used To Eschew Her Role Rather Vehemently
KANAYA: The Duties Of Our Caste Were Quite Limiting In Both Worlds It Seems
KANAYA: So She Renounced Them Completely And Wanted A Different Life
KANAYA: But She Also Said Something To The Effect That
KANAYA: She Found That It Wasnt Really Necessary To Reject That Role Completely
KANAYA: And The Same Is True For Me
KANAYA: As Long As I Know Within That I Am Free
KANAYA: And If My Decision Is To Embrace My Path Then It Can Be A Source Of Strength
KANAYA: Its True Theres No Orb Anymore
KANAYA: She Said It May Be Very Difficult
KANAYA: But Theres No Hope If I Dont Try
KANAYA: I Dont Know How Im Going To Do It Yet
KANAYA: But Such Is The Nature Of Adventures
KANAYA: You Cant Be Scared Of Adventures
KANAYA: I Think Im Excited About It Now
KANAYA: I Hope So
KANAYA: Oh No I Can Flip It Back On
KANAYA: See
KANAYA: Turns Out Its Just
KANAYA: A Silly Biological Parlor Trick
KANAYA: Sorry
KANAYA: I Know How You Enjoy A Good Source Of Light
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: Hence The Ghost Who Is Following Me
KANAYA: She Is Exhibiting Her Best Behavior While On This Tour
KANAYA: Shes Actually Doing Very Well So Far
KANAYA: Shh!
KANAYA: So What Were You Just Mumbling Over Here Before I Interrupted You
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: I Know What Your Raps Are Theyre Basically The Same As The Ancient Artform Of Alternian Slam Poetry
KANAYA: But More Primitive And Generally Involving Less Lyrics About Towering Muscular Livestock
KANAYA: I Dont Know I Dont Really Have Much Interest In The Subject
KANAYA: Well There You Go
KANAYA: Um
KANAYA: If You Are Successful In Extracting Blood From The Geological Material In Question Can I Have It
KANAYA: I Dont Know How Sincere Youre Being Dave
KANAYA: Probably Only Somewhat Since The Rule Is That Everything Has To Be At Least Partially A Joke Right
KANAYA: But If You Actually Want To Converse And Exchange Views On Our Respective Cultures Then Okay I Guess Thats Fine
KANAYA: I Might Be Able To Dig Up Some Classic Texts By Some Famous Slam Poets
KANAYA: Ok I Will See What I Can Do
KANAYA: Heh Sure
KANAYA: Oh
KANAYA: Is It Too Late To Back Out Of This
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: By The Tenor Of The Question Ill Assume More Than You Would Prefer
KANAYA: I Wasnt
KANAYA: I Was Just Standing Here And You Slowly Wandered Over In A Totally Oblivious Stupor
KANAYA: You Were Mumbling Your Rhymes And Walked Right Up To Me And Did Not Notice Me Until Now
KANAYA: They Then Proceeded To Have One Of The Most Ambiguously Rated Rap Offs In The History Of Paradox Space While I Stood By And Regarded It Neutrally
KANAYA: I Dont Know
KANAYA: What Do You Think
KANAYA: I Could Go Either Way
KANAYA: Ill Probably Switch On If Im Walking Through A Dark Corridor
KANAYA: Now That I Think About It
KANAYA: Its Been A Long Time Since I Could Even Be In The Dark
KANAYA: Maybe Ill Leave It Off For A While And Refamiliarize Myself With The Experience Of Nonillumination
KANAYA: Um
KANAYA: No Thats Ok
KANAYA: Im Told Its A Trait Confined To Those Of My Caste
KANAYA: They Tended To Spend A Lot Of Time In The Brooding Caverns Where A Convenient Source Of Light Was Often Handy
KANAYA: That Part Of It Makes Sense To Me But I Have No Idea What The Evolutionary Purpose Was For The Sort Of Thirst Which Accompanies This Perk
KANAYA: Strikes Me As An Odd Liability But What Do I Know
KANAYA: Maybe
KANAYA: Or Perhaps It Was A Measured Defect Imposed On Us
KANAYA: To Keep The Auxiliatrices On A Short Leash
KANAYA: The Condition Was Often Glamorized In Certain Works Of Literature
KANAYA: But Theres Really Nothing That Great About It
KANAYA: Not Nearly As Useful As Other Abilities Like The Psychic Gifts Which Some Lowbloods Are Predisposed To
KANAYA: Though I Guess Its Pretty Useful If You Want To Keep The Plans You Made After Someone Punches A Hole Through Your Gut
KANAYA: Not Really
KANAYA: Sure
KANAYA: Anything In Particular That You Have In Mind
KANAYA: Yeah That Sounds Okay
KANAYA: Good Evening
KANAYA: Oh
KANAYA: Hmm
KANAYA: Am I
KANAYA: Underdressed For The Occasion
KANAYA: If Id Known You Wanted To Dress In More Elegant Attire I Would Have Happily Uh
KANAYA: Hmmm
KANAYA: Well
KANAYA: If Um
KANAYA: You Think Im Fine Like This Then Okay
KANAYA: Rose
KANAYA: Are You Feeling Alright
KANAYA: Ah
KANAYA: It Seems You May Have Imbibed One Of Your Experimental Human Soporifics
KANAYA: Whoah
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: Well Then
KANAYA: I Guess That Would Explain It
KANAYA: The Lethargy You Possibly Experienced When It Came To Completing Our Rendezvous In A Timely Manner
KANAYA: I Was Waiting For You In The Common Area For A Couple Hours But You Did Not Show Up
KANAYA: So
KANAYA: I Came To Find You
KANAYA: Our Date
KANAYA: Then
KANAYA: You Did Intend For The Plans We Made To Be A Date
KANAYA: Which Is To Say One That Was Romantically Oriented
KANAYA: Well
KANAYA: Im Still Amenable To An Evening Of
KANAYA: Whatever
KANAYA: But
KANAYA: Is There Some Reason Why You Would Advise Otherwise Dave
KANAYA: I Will Have To Plead Ignorance On The Subject Of Human Courtship And Its Customs When It Involves One Or More Intoxicated Participants
KANAYA: Is There A Problem
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: Alright
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: After You
KANAYA: If You Can Actually
KANAYA: Manage To
KANAYA: Whoa There!
KANAYA: Maintain Your Balance
KANAYA: Okay
KANAYA: Are You Good
KANAYA: Okay Good
KANAYA: Lets Go
KANAYA: Since Its Now Clear That Your Premeditated Designs On This Evening Exceeded My Own By A Wide Margin
KANAYA: Insofar As You Intended This To Be A Date With Fancy Clothes Whereas I Showed Up Looking Like Something The Lusus Dragged In
KANAYA: Maybe You Can Tell Me Now Exactly What You Had In Mind
KANAYA: I Mean
KANAYA: As Far As Specific Activities Are Concerned
KANAYA: Noupe
KANAYA: I Mean Nope
KANAYA: Nope What
KANAYA: Its Really Okay Though
KANAYA: I Admit I Was Irked For A Moment But Then Realized It Was So Unlike You That Extenuating Circumstances Were Most Likely In Play
KANAYA: So I Went To Find You And Lo And Behold
KANAYA: Extenuation Was What I Found To Be Taking Place
KANAYA: What
KANAYA: No Hear What
KANAYA: That Better
KANAYA: (what are we listening for)
KANAYA: Yes That Sounds Nice
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: And What
KANAYA: !!!
KANAYA: You Did
KANAYA: Where??
KANAYA: Actually
KANAYA: Theres No Need To Worry About That
KANAYA: I Think Im Done Trying To Kill Him
KANAYA: Yeah
KANAYA: He Has Achieved Victory Through The Gambit Of Cowards Default
KANAYA: Dont Get Me Wrong He Is Still Utterly Awful
KANAYA: But Sometimes You Just Have To Let A Thing Go
KANAYA: You Know
KANAYA: What Were You Saying About Terezi And Gamzee
KANAYA: What
KANAYA: Are You Serious
KANAYA: Why
KANAYA: That Could Be Very Awkward Yes
KANAYA: Me Too
KANAYA: I Can See The Dilemma Here
KANAYA: Are You Actually Thinking About
KANAYA: Um
KANAYA: Doing Something About This
KANAYA: I Understand
KANAYA: But What Youre Describing Is
KANAYA: Hmm
KANAYA: Actually Im Hesitant To Even Mention It
KANAYA: This Is Probably Not A Good Idea
KANAYA: The Feelings You Are Having Are Actually Perfectly Normal Within The Framework Of Our Quadrant Based Romantic Tradition
KANAYA: I Dont Know If They Can Be Felt Naturally By Humans But The Way You Are Viewing Their Relationship Would Be Quite A Standard Response On Alternia
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: It Is Sanctioned Within The Ashen Quadrant
KANAYA: Which Addresses Conciliatory Romantic Feelings Not Directed At A Single Person
KANAYA: But At Two People Who Are Presently In Such A Contentious Relationship
KANAYA: It Is Generally Not Regarded As One Of The More Emotionally Fulfilling Quadrants To Become Involved In
KANAYA: And Can Be Quite Laborious To Maintain
KANAYA: But It Served A Very Important Social Purpose For My People
KANAYA: Such As In Situations Very Similar To The One You Described
KANAYA: Where Two Parties Are Highly Drawn To Each Other Through Animosity
KANAYA: They May In Fact Be Perfect For Each Other In That Tumultuous Quadrant
KANAYA: But To Pursue The Relationship Would Be Chaos
KANAYA: Much Like The Scenario You Laid Out The Two Kismeses If Left Unchecked Would Devastate All Their Other Relationships
KANAYA: Those In Their Own Quadrants And Even Those In Other Peoples
KANAYA: So It Is The Job Of An Auspistice To Make Sure That Doesnt Happen
KANAYA: Oh No
KANAYA: Really
KANAYA: I Dont Think I Would Advise It
KANAYA: Its Extremely Difficult And Can Often Feel Like A Thankless Undertaking
KANAYA: In Truth It Is Probably The Most Challenging Quadrant To Master
KANAYA: Trust Me
KANAYA: I
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: I Really
KANAYA: Dont Know If I Would Be A Good Teacher
KANAYA: Of Auspisticism
KANAYA: I Honestly Was Not Very Good At It Myself
KANAYA: Everything
KANAYA: That Is
KANAYA: A Lot Of Things
Kanaya: Yes!
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: ...
KANAYA: Rose You Are Willfully Ignoring My Trail Of Finish Crumbs
KANAYA: I Said Them Quietly In Sequence To Convey One Of Your Human Pregnant Pauses Before Speaking
KANAYA: The Pause Was Human Expecting In The Same Sense That I Am Expecting An Explanation For Your Present Conduct
KANAYA: We Were To Meet The Others On The Roof By Now
KANAYA: Im Trying To Toll... To Tell You That We Are On The Verge Of Reaching Our Destination And Here I Find You Doing
KANAYA: What Are You Doing Exactly
KANAYA: What
KANAYA: !
KANAYA: You Have Been Drinking Your Soporifics In Excess Again
KANAYA: Rose This Is Terrible
KANAYA: No But
KANAYA: Really What Are You Doing Here In The Tiny Simulated Village
KANAYA: Are You
KANAYA: Are You Writing Numbers On All Of These Nutrition Cylinders
KANAYA: Yes
KANAYA: You Have Mentioned This
KANAYA: Tallcircles
KANAYA: Tallcircles No That Sucks
KANAYA: Answer My Question Please Why Are You Numbering The Tallcirc...
KANAYA: CANS
KANAYA: You Want To Relocate The City
KANAYA: Now??
KANAYA: This Is Such A Foolish Use Of Your Time
KANAYA: I Think The Torch Is Not All You Have Managed To Keep Lit
KANAYA: ......
KANAYA: So Many Finish Crumbs Up In Here
KANAYA: You Said Some Of Those Words Two Or Three Times And Most Of Them Werent Words
KANAYA: I Do Not Believe This
KANAYA: You Promised Me You Would Be Ready For Our Arrival
KANAYA: This Is Not Ready!
KANAYA: When I Said Ready I Believe Your Sobriety Was More Than Implied As The Operative Criterion
KANAYA: Ugh!
KANAYA: I Have Been As Polite As I Can Be But Honestly Your Demeanor Is Not Nearly As Charming As You Appear To Believe When You Have Consumed A Lot Of That Liquid
KANAYA: You Have Assured Me That Chronic And Habitual Exploitation Of This Substance Is "Not A Problem" For Your People But At This Point I Must Conclude That You Were Just Lying!
KANAYA: Why
KANAYA: Why Did You Do This Just Before Our Arrival When You Told Me You Wouldnt!!!
KANAYA: But You Cant Help Us Like This!
KANAYA: We Need You!
KANAYA: Youre The Smartest One On This Meteor!
KANAYA: By Quite A Lot!
KANAYA: What
KANAYA: Okay That Was Literally The Most Inebriated Thing You Have Ever Said
KANAYA: You Are Not Actually Suggesting This Simple Creature Dressed In Rags Is Your Intellectual Superior
KANAYA: How Would One Even Draw This Conclusion
KANAYA: He Does Not Speak
KANAYA: He Does Not Have His Ways He Likes Cans And Little Pretend Cities And He Is Rather Adorable And That Is Pretty Much All There Is To Say About The Mayor
KANAYA: Please Do Not Distract From Important Issues With Talk Of Fake Mayors
KANAYA: This Is Not A Hypothetical Exercise In Your Earth Psychiatrics!
KANAYA: You Made A Promise To Me And You Did Not Keep It!
KANAYA: Yes You Are Usually Very Smart And We All Need You But More Importantly I Need You!
KANAYA: Dont You Remember!
KANAYA: You Said You Would Help Me Resurrect My Species!
KANAYA: I Still Dont Know How Im Going To Acquire A New Matriorb!
KANAYA: How Are We Supposed To Solve That Problem When Your Think Pan Is Addled So!
KANAYA: That Is Not Reassuring Coming From You Like This!
KANAYA: I Often Cant Tell Even At Your Most Lucid If You Put Too Much Trust In Your Seering Abilities
KANAYA: But When You Say Such Things While Obscured By These Toxins You Sound Outright Delusional!
KANAYA: You Stumble Around This Lab In Such High Spirits Which Makes It Impossible To Broach The Subject From A Standpoint Of Mutual Agreement That Your Behavior Is A Problem!
KANAYA: ARGH YOU SEE
KANAYA: No Not Exactly
KANAYA: I Have Already Explained
KANAYA: You Have Severely Hobbled Your Intellect And Your Efficacy
KANAYA: The Objectives You Prioritize Have Become Ridiculous
KANAYA: You Have Just Now Decided To Draw A Map Of A False Metropolis!
KANAYA: Others Have Suffered As Well
KANAYA: What Ever Happened To Your Concern For Terezi And Gamzee
KANAYA: Were All My Lessons In Auspisticism For Nothing??
KANAYA: I Know Its Hard!
KANAYA: Its Supposed To Be Hard!!
KANAYA: And My Name Is Not Kakaka!!!
KANAYA: You Cannot Say It!
KANAYA: Because You Are!
KANAYA: HUMAN DRUNK!!!!!!!!!!
KANAYA: Raaararraauuuaaaauuaghghgghgggghhgh!
KANAYA: NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
KANAYA: (hisssss...)
GA: Whos We 
GA: Of Course Not 
GA: But If Youre Referring To The Short Term Memory Loss We All Seem To Be Experiencing Yes Ive Got That Too 
GA: How Do You Know Im On Lofaf 
GA: I Didnt Think Karkat Could Remember The Acronyms For Your Planets 
GA: Okay 
GA: Shes Apparently On Lolar 
GA: Shes With Rose 
GA: No 
GA: But It Seems Theyve Both Surmised The Missing Events Since We Arrived 
GA: Well They Are Seers After All 
GA: Im A Sylph!!! 
GA: I Am On Record As Once Having Facetiously Likened It To A Magical Witch 
GA: If Its Any Reassurance You Seem Like The Same Old Dave To Me 
GA: I Dont Know 
GA: Rose Was Trying To Tell Me But She Ceased Being Comprehensible
GA: No 
GA: Its Just That Her Words Suddenly Became 
GA: Why Dont You Just Talk To Her And See For Yourself 
GA: I Know Right 
KANAYA: (You Do Realize I Spoke To Jade Plenty Of Times Myself) 
KANAYA: No 
KANAYA: I Second Your Motion 
KANAYA: Um 
KANAYA: So 
KANAYA: No?
KANAYA: How Do You Figure 
KANAYA: I Think You Are Presuming To Know A Lot About My Nature Which Is Not Actually True 
KANAYA: It Sounds As Though Youre Suggesting That I Have Qualities Similar To Certain Types Of Shadow Droppers Which Is Not Quite The Case But Even If It Was There Are A Lot Of Myths About Shadow Dropper Physiology That Are Commonly Perpetuated By Popular... 
KANAYA: Why Would You Do That! 
KANAYA: I Do Not Understand Why You Needed To Impale My Friend To Demonstrate Your Resurrection Abilities! 
KANAYA: I Believed You! 
KANAYA: It Was Pointless And Cruel And Does Not Advance My Willingness To Cooperate With You At All! 
KANAYA: Furthermore It Did Not Prove That You Can Use Said Abilities To Harm Me! 
KANAYA: I Believe That Assertion Was Based On A Fallacious Theory About My Constitution! 
KANAYA: In Actuality One Could Easily Kill Me With Any Number Of Conventional Methods! 
KANAYA: Im Sure You Could Chop My Head Off Or Burn Me Alive Or Crush Me To Death And I Would Die Just Fine! 
KANAYA: I Am Not Scared Of You! 
KANAYA: None Of Us Are! 
KANAYA: Karkat Shut Up! 
KANAYA: If This Treacherous Despot Serving Turncoat Seeks Compliance From Me Then She Will Have To Pry It From My Mutilated Lifeless Cadaver! 
KANAYA: If You Are So Convinced That Your Recuperative Magic Will Strike Me Down Then Why Dont You Put Your Theory To The Test! 
KANAYA: I Doubt You Will Since You Have Made It Clear You Need Our Participation To Achieve Your Goals Which Is A Fact That Your Naive Cohort Foolishly Revealed To Us! 
KANAYA: I Dont Think She Is Very Good At Being A Villain And To Be Honest I Have My Doubts About You As Well So I Am Calling Your Bluff! 
KANAYA: So If You Continue To Insist That Your Healing Enchantments Have The Power To Slay Me Then I Implore You To Give It Your Best Shot! 
KANAYA: Go On Do It! 
KANAYA: DO YOUR HUMAN WORST! 
KANAYA: Wait 
KANAYA: You Can Talk 
KANAYA: Using Actual Sentences 
KANAYA: Then Why Resort Exclusively To Intimidating Robotic Soundbites For 
KANAYA: However Long You Were Doing That 
KANAYA: ... 
KANAYA: Okay 
GA: Yes 
GA: Oh 
GA: She Wants Us To Speak With Echidna 
GA: Yes 
GA: About Releasing The New Frog 
GA: Hi 
GA: Yeah 
GA: What Problem 
GA: Oh 
GA: Right 
GA: Okay 
GA: No 
GA: Well 
GA: Yes Sort Of 
GA: Im Um 
GA: Just Buying Some Things 
GA: Just Some 
GA: Provisions 
GA: A Local Vendor 
GA: No 
GA: Definitely Not Jars Of 
GA: Bugs 
GA: No 
GA: I Really Should Go 
GA: Lets Talk About My Problem Later 
GA: Yes 
GA: Definitely 
GA: Bye
