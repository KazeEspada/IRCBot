TG: plus let you attack stuff whenever things get too hot to handle
TG: which is never
TG: what have you got
TG: wow you really suck at this dont you
TG: just get rid of the arms and then allocate the hammer to the specibus

TG: i was worried we were on the verge of getting some shit done
TG: well where are they
TG: you say there will be stairs
TG: and yet
TG: i see no stairs
TG: sorry
TG: am i supposed to break that thing
TG: or hatch it
TG: or what
TG: also what happened to all my shit
TG: the stuff scattered all over the roof
TG: did you put it somewhere
TG: i mean not that i care
TG: it was a lot of mostly useless garbage
TG: i was going to use it to fight my bro with
TG: but i guess i forgot in the heat of battle
TG: also he was too fast
TG: ok so
TG: the egg is now in a nest made of shitty swords and soft puppet ass
TG: please advise
TG: do you think thatll take more than four hours
TG: its hot as the sizzle side of the steak
TG: maybe i should try to get it back
TG: and put it in the microwave
TG: you mean the jumper block thing
TG: wait what
TG: the thing costs 1000 for me
TG: what
TG: man i only got 200 to splash around with in roses rainbow world
TG: what the hell
TG: hang on ill ask
TG: she says 20
TG: yeah
TG: so i guess you can buy everything now
TG: ok now i know youre making this shit up
TG: well all i got here is the designix which i cant deploy cause i dont have any purples
TG: and the expensive as hell jumper thing and the cheap shunts which i assume do dick all without the jumpers to put em on
TG: oh also this cd which is 100 but i didnt drop cause it seemed like a stiff allocation of resources for now
TG: so with each new connection in our player chain i guess new weird deployables are introduced
TG: hey look we're learning stuff
TG: what should i do with these beta copies
TG: i dont really need them anymore
TG: wow that was a weird answer
TG: but ok
TG: ok
TG: so i guess this is just a built in designix
TG: which is sort of cool i guess
TG: since i wont have to go downstairs and bang the hallway door into the thing and squeeze through every time i want to punch a card
TG: because of course you couldnt have just put it next to the alchemiter in the first place
TG: but then i have to go downstairs anyway to make totems and get cruxite and stuff
TG: so really who cares
TG: im building up your house
TG: by the way why do you live in this weird compound
TG: do you host east european industrial raves
TG: nevermind the point is
TG: im out of grist
TG: so if youre done whipping that ogre like a rented mule
TG: maybe you could convert it into a grist windfall
TG: i dont know beach the thing first i guess
TG: unless you were planning on sailing that ogre down the mississippi with a runaway slave
TG: what do you mean
TG: you kill it
TG: release a shitload of grist
TG: maybe take one of your needles and puncture the base of its skull
TG: does it even have a skull
TG: or a brain stem
TG: can you find out
TG: what
TG: but you just rigged the thing with an oedipal harness and rode its torso like a log flume ride down a magical rainbow
TG: this is bullshit its an unfeeling monster who gives a fuck
TG: wow fuck ok
TG: you can either kill it for the loot or wait a couple hours for gristtorrent to steal more of johns
TG: but then again ill be pretty busy in a couple hours so make up your mind
TG: no but hes still got a ton so screw him
TG: yeah me too
TG: who
TG: oh yeah sure
TG: i command her alright i am like the pimpmaster hustledaddy of all snippy bookshrews
TG: wrong what do you want
TG: what the hell
TG: you have no idea dude she is so in my grill
TG: like a stray hotdog that rolled down there
TG: and now its too much trouble to fish out with the tongs
TG: so you just watch it like crack and turn black
TG: man wait
TG: whats this about
TG: you have a thing for her dont you
TG: dont deny it bro its obvious
TG: hahahaha so terrible
TG: what a transparent dodge
TG: all hiding behind your alien shit
TG: just admit it
TG: you want me to help you win her over
TG: ok well its easy
TG: for everything she says take her to mean just the opposite
TG: see not everybody always means literally what they say the way john and jade always do
TG: oh my flipping christ
TG: ok if you want rose to dig you you got to leave that crap in the shitty scifi novels where it belongs
TG: oh ok
TG: that was pretty good
TG: maybe even too deadpan but its a start keep at it
TG: hahaha yes youre on a roll
TG: oh
TG: alright look
TG: if you want to keep her attention you got to pull out all the stops
TG: reverse psychology mind games all sorts of machiavellian bullshit
TG: i mean unless youre really smooth and inherently likeable like me which youre not
TG: thats kind of the obtuse alien way of getting it but yeah
TG: be like
TG: an antagonism ninja
TG: like her
TG: i dont know you sort of remind me of her anyway so maybe thats a good thing
TG: it could be a horrible thing though
TG: yeah i guess i am
TG: i guess im saying be a less shitty troll
TG: good luck bro
TG: dont care
TG: ok im in
TG: the medium
TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn hours
TG: i dont want to talk about it
TG: imagine the worst day of my life
TG: just stood up and clinked a glass like it was about to give a speech
TG: then took a shit in my dinner and passed out with its pants down
TG: yeah
TG: stfu
TG: what are you doing
TG: ok
TG: i need some advice
TG: my kernelsprite which was this brainless feathery asshole with a sword in it
TG: turned into this bigger like ghostly feathery asshole
TG: with a sword in it
TG: it seems to want me to prototype it again
TG: not sure what to do
TG: shes asleep for some reason
TG: yeah i saw her there
TG: all tuckered out
TG: like she got smacked in the face with a pillow case full of the snooze wizards beard dander
TG: cause obviously its fuckin prime time for swiping some shuteye about now
TG: like a few hours into her magic stupid quest
TG: anyway what do you think
TG: ok fine but
TG: it seems to be suggesting something here
TG: and
TG: i guess im kinda weirded out by its suggestion
TG: ok well it definitely sounds like youre fucking something up over there
TG: but alright later
DAVE: shut up
DAVE: no
DAVE: just
DAVE: god damn it
DAVE: please
DAVE: just once
DAVE: shut the hell up
DAVE: shut up
DAVE: shut
DAVE: the
DAVE: fuck
DAVE: up
TG: thats it i cant take it anymore
TG: it was such a huge mistake prototyping seppucrow with this useless mindnumbing jackass
TG: im going back
TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn months
TG: or something
TG: i dont know im kind of losing track of how long its been with all this time hopping
TG: what else is there to know
TG: we lost
TG: cant finish the game with a dead heir and witch
TG: yeah well she had a big fucking meteor bearing down on her and we never heard from her again
TG: or the trolls for that matter
TG: after they tricked john into skipping way ahead and getting his ass handed to him by the denizen
TG: i guess once they managed to sabotage us they were done with us
TG: and since john died he couldnt get jade in on time so whether shes alive or not shes as good as dead from our perspective 
TG: only thing left to do is change all that
TG: theres not much to remember
TG: i go back and tell john not to be an idiot and get trolled like such a gullible stooge
TG: i dont know what he was thinking
TG: even we couldnt kill one of those things yet
TG: with our higher levels and all our sick gear
TG: nah itll be fine dont worry
TG: i dont know
TG: i mean your whole timeline will
TG: maybe
TG: the thing with time travel is
TG: you cant overthink it
TG: just roll with it and see what happens
TG: and above all try not to do anything retarded
TG: try going to sleep
TG: our dream selves kind of operate outside the normal time continuum i think
TG: so if part of you from this timelines going to persist thats probably the way to make it happen
TG: and hey you might even be able to help your past dream self wake up sooner without all that fuss you went through
TG: the true purpose is to make a sprite that doesnt make me want to flog myself raw with my own brain stem
TG: anything else is gravy
TG: yeah thatd be cool i guess
TG: im gonna go now
TG: ok im in
TG: the medium
TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn hours
TG: i dont want to talk about it
TG: imagine the worst day of my life
TG: just stood up and clinked a glass like it was about to give a speech
TG: then took a shit in my dinner and passed out with its pants down
TG: yeah
TG: stfu
TG: what are you doing
TG: ok
TG: i need some advice
TG: my kernelsprite which was this brainless feathery asshole with a sword in it
TG: turned into this bigger like ghostly feathery asshole
TG: with a sword in it
TG: it seems to want me to prototype it again
TG: not sure what to do
TG: shes asleep for some reason
TG: yeah i saw her there
TG: all tuckered out

TG: anyway what do you think
TG: ok fine but
TG: it seems to be suggesting something here
TG: and
TG: i guess im kinda weirded out by its suggestion
TG: ok well it definitely sounds like youre fucking something up over there
TG: but alright later
TG: WAIT
TG: dont go yet
TG: somethings up
TG: ok its me from the future
TG: its me
TG: i just appeared
TG: from the future
TG: wearing a rad suit
TG: he says dont go
TG: or youre gonna die
TG: he says i dunno gullible enough to trust a leetspeaking troll who wants you dead and strap on a rocket pack cause she said to
TG: ok that was probably the dumbest thing you ever said just now
TG: do you hear what youre saying oh my god
TG: this guy is me if i get him to talk to you youre just talking to me again jesus it proves nothing
TG: john stop being a tool and unbuckle yourself from that piece of shit
TG: if our friendship means anything youll listen to me and past dave
TG: this is future dave by the way
TG: yeah exactly why would i bother
TG: this sort of cornball horseshit is your cup of tea not mine
TG: dont make me track you down through time and stop you in person
TG: oh god did you just blast off
TG: ok well just dont ok
TG: im turning this timeline over to past dave
TG: and helping you all stay alive and do this thing the right way this time
TG: just stay on the goddamn ground for fucks sake
DAVE: hey
DAVE: who were you talking to
DAVE: ok cool
DAVE: so now that youre a sprite
DAVE: do you know everything about the game
DAVE: alright
DAVE: here goes
DAVE: why are we so fucking awesome
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: so is everything cool with this john business
DAVE: is he gonna be ok
DAVE: ok
DAVE: like what
DAVE: i was in the middle of the nancho party arc
DAVE: yeah that was sorta the plan
DAVE: making a ten part story about nachos was always a bullshit idea
DAVE: yeah sure
TG: did you blast off like a spazzy douche yet or what
TG: god dammit what do i have to do to make you believe me
TG: fist bump my future self til i got bloody knuckles and write you an even sappier bday note in my own blood
TG: on a back to the future poster
TG: oh ok
TG: so you believe me then
TG: about future me
TG: and like
TG: him turning into a floating sword bird
TG: oh man and if weve just concluded anything its that talking to those dbags should be priority number one so yeah go right ahead
TG: yo
TG: what did you do
TG: ahahahahaha
TG: pff
TG: dont worry about it
TG: cause i wouldnt give a shit
TG: and hes me
TG: what
TG: really
TG: ok
TG: dont go anywhere
TG: im coming down to the computer
TG: ok i dont know what youre doing here
TG: but i think we can both agree that youve got to rummage through as much of her shit as possible before she wakes up
TG: dude no come on
TG: shes out like a light anyway
TG: it was some like weird future thing that happened that made her sleep
TG: yeah
TG: shit doesnt get more clear than that
TG: fine dont
TG: but here just do this one thing
TG: see those two notebooks on the floor behind you
TG: you dont have to read them im not telling you to
TG: what kind of prying tool do you take me for
TG: just pick them up
TG: you know like tidy up a bit since you made a royal fucking dump of her room just now
TG: now i need you to do something else
TG: this is important
TG: like for important game reasons and stuff
TG: take the card the books are on
TG: flip it over
TG: so you can see the code
TG: dude you dont have to tell me the code
TG: just flip it over and let me know if theres a code there thats all
TG: alright cool
TG: you can ditch the books now if you want
TG: maybe put them back on the floor
TG: so rose doesnt think you were snooping
TG: seriously youve got some grubby fingers bro why dont you mind your own business there
TG: what is even with you
TG: isnt that your birthday package there
TG: maybe you should look at it
TG: i dont think it counts as snooping since its technically yours
TG: whoa why are you burning your wizard fanfiction
TG: oh ok
TG: then why are you burning that
TG: is that some dumb wizard thing you just made up
TG: or something to do with tentacle monsters
TG: i cant keep track of what you like anymore
TG: john told me
TG: he was all snoopin around your room while you were asleep and i was like no man dont
TG: so not cool
TG: then he was like haha dude check it out this book is full of wizard slash
TG: and i was like i dont even want to know this is such a crazy violation of privacy
TG: do you want me to chew him out about it i will because that was so outrageous i dont know where he got off being like that
TG: i thought you hated wizards
TG: whats the deal with that
TG: oh man thats so messed up
TG: that you think that
TG: she probably digs wizards for real just like you and youre blowing shit out of proportion like pretty much always
TG: you and she could probably have been chatting up how awesome wizards were this whole time but no
TG: youre probably burning your nutjob meow book to spite her too arent you
TG: oh yeah
TG: i thought that was a joke
TG: when did they say that
TG: you mean when we were dancing and stuff in our dreams
TG: ive never seen or heard these things in my dreams
TG: uh yeah
TG: no what a ridiculous question
TG: ....
TG: ........
TG: ..........................
TG: dunno
TG: anyway yeah i guess ill do that
TG: get some sky monsters to boss me around sounds cool
TG: are you talking to future me
TG: ok im out of the loop again
TG: between you taking orders from dream beasts and bird wing me with like
TG: future secrets
TG: im doing some sort of spectacular fucking jackknife off the loop and getting a wink and a nod from barack obana
TG: im coming upstairs
DAVE: so it was pretty funny how i made a copy of roses evil book right before she burned it and now she doesnt know about it
DAVE: the best thing about how i did that is how it in no way will ever come back to bite us in the ass ever
DAVE: so safe
DAVE: safer than some flintstone vitamins in a bottle
DAVE: keep twisting junior all you get is clicks
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: anyway guess ill go back down and burn that book
TG: what
TG: fuck off
TG: youre the annoying blind one arent you
TG: dave told me about you
TG: man im telling you burns like that are unreal
TG: where do you even get a burn thats that sick
TG: no you messed that up
TG: uh
TG: did you try to draw shades on his face and miss
TG: whats even the point hes already wearing shades
TG: this is moronic
TG: i dont know what it smells like or tastes like
TG: but i sure as hell know what it looks like
TG: like a fuckin symphony on my retinas
TG: shit is beautiful like a little vermilion picnic on my hands
TG: every day i open my eyes i find poetry in even the simplest things
TG: just one of those little joys in life you take for granted you know
TG: this miraculous gift of vision
TG: i could give myself a hernia trying to be as big a douche as that guy
TG: i could try but it would wind up like a motorcycle stunt gone horribly wrong
TG: my broken body would flop and tumble around like a rag doll
TG: and yet as much as that guys the tooliest dude i could ever hope to meet he and i would still get along famously
TG: cause we can both see
TG: just him and me
TG: havin a see party
TG: like a couple of eagle eyed bros peepin shit up into the wee hours
TG: i guess but youll have to be careful not to stumble around bumping into all the gorgeous masterpieces hanging around everywhere
TG: god so beautiful to look at with my perfect eyesight
TG: yeah thats fine
TG: oh hell
TG: that
TG: ok thats pretty amazing
TG: hey speaking of which
TG: where is my bro anyway
TG: havent seen him at all since i got here
TG: davesprite doesnt know
TG: you can see everything that goes on right
TG: or like smell it or whatever
TG: how does that even work
TG: how do you use a computer and know whats going on it doesnt make sense
TG: my face doesnt make sense
TG: hahaha
TG: ew
TG: oh ok
TG: so the dumbest and most far fetched explanation imaginable ok got it
TG: man dont remind me about that
TG: so embarrassing
TG: ok cool
TG: whos upset
TG: bout time the dude gave me a little space
TG: i guess
TG: alright so whats next
TG: why would i be scared
TG: we have cotton candy dumpass
TG: hey
TG: has it
TG: man who cares
TG: i mean thats great and all
TG: but i talked to you plenty more times since that from where im standing
TG: ive got to make this quick
TG: fuck no fuck that trollian horseshit
TG: its just regular old time travel
TG: im from the future
TG: no
TG: just regular ordinary dave from the fucking future nothing special dude come on
TG: yeah ok it is awesome but im in a hurry
TG: i need to borrow some boondollars off you
TG: no they do do something
TG: what do you think they buy shit its fucking money
TG: i cant answer all these questions dude youll find out anyway its not like youll even really need your money
TG: you you might as well give it to me
TG: all of it
TG: man you just said you thought it was useless why do you care
TG: ill pay you back
TG: in the future
TG: if theres one thing im not short on its the fuckin future
TG: yeah we do
TG: but chronologically ive been around for at least triple that
TG: no shit your deal is wind not time
TG: youre on easy street what is there even to think about with wind
TG: like what angle to blow it at to fly a damn kite or how gentle its gotta be to make a picnic go swimmingly
TG: its kiddie bullshit time is serious fucking business
TG: leave it to the pros ok
TG: yeah it can work that way
TG: or not
TG: ive been very careful
TG: this whole operation is strung together with stable time loops
TG: no timeline offshoots cause thats when daves start dying and that isnt no good for nobody
TG: yeah
TG: there are a bunch of daves running around the timeline
TG: but they are all me
TG: i mean they will all become me and ill become them one way or another
TG: thats how stable time loops work shit takes a lot of planning and precise choreography
TG: ive got some help though
TG: yeah
TG: man dont even get me started with that
TG: the 24 hour span of the reckoning is like some kind of critical spike in us dealing with troll bullshit
TG: i guess its just when the most shit is going down so they figure thats the best time to mess with us
TG: i dont know man they seem to flock to me
TG: ive been laying waste to chumps nonstop
TG: its like they heard somebody over here was handing out asses and theyve known nothing but years of bitter ass famine
TG: oh you know
TG: noirs outta control
TG: rose is crazy jades crazier and youre
TG: well youre you
TG: and together were up to our bulges and miscellaneous bullshit alien physiology in hot sloppy shenanigans while hatching plans under our feathery asses like a bunch of cage free farm fresh motherfuckers
TG: but im not about to get into specifics cause this is complicated enough as it is
TG: and if i started ranting too much about the future id start sounding like one of these smug alternian shitheads and im not about to drop that retarded science on my good bro
TG: so im staying on track here
TG: speaking of which
TG: give me your money
TG: oh christ
TG: only one
TG: well fuck nevermind then
TG: i thought youd have more by now but thats goddamn peanuts
TG: i mean
TG: ill take it anyway but damn

TG: using time loops to manipulate the incipispheres financial sector
TG: making a goddamn killing in the lohacse
TG: lohac stock exchange
TG: my planet
TG: land of heat and clockwork dude come on
TG: you know like gears and lava and shit

TG: yeah i mean
TG: i cant possibly argue with any of that
TG: so are we done making money yet or what
TG: yeah i kinda figured
TG: im not complaining
TG: but you said there was something specific we were working toward here
TG: i mean aside from buying up all the nastiest fraymotifs
TG: competitive
TG: man
TG: dont matter what i do im not gonna outpace egbert
TG: hey its not like the futures a mystery or anything weve both seen it
TG: well
TG: ive seen it
TG: youve just caught a whiff of it
TG: like a hungry beggar loitering cross the street of an olive garden
TG: just cause a filthy vagrants barred from entry dont mean a dude doesnt know italian foods nearby its a fucking fact to his nose
TG: yeah fine
TG: so whats the other thing we were accomplishing here
TG: does that get to be not an obnoxious secret yet
TG: ok so this was your game
TG: to get rich off me
TG: alright well its not like i even have a problem parting with this useless bullshit money
TG: how much do you need

TG: i can afford to give you a fuckload more than that
TG: how bout i give you an even boonbank

TG: damn
TG: those moves
TG: i can see im going to have to drop everything
TG: drop it like its simultaneously hot and i just tripped over the rug
TG: dedicate my undivided attention to this shit
TG: damn youre right
TG: truth be told everyone will be tripping when im done
TG: once i upset this biznasty with my swift cuts
TG: dudes will phalanx themselves agape like theyre offerin to store my shit in their mouths for the night
TG: rows of glasseyed human fly catchers beholding categorical fucking domination of the dance floor
TG: but they wont catch none cause the flys all mine
TG: theres not any i dont have
TG: im crafting a new dance move
TG: to shock the shit out of asses in pants
TG: fred astaires ghost will weep in the arms of his own nimble rotting corpse
TG: its called
TG: the smug cracker parlor wiggle
TG: of course
TG: and just when the scene thought it was startin to recover from its ridiculous erection over that
TG: thats when i bust out another fierce move
TG: i call it rageclock me in the douche smirk plz
TG: cut out to the rude jam "askin 4 it!"
TG: id say if i had to take an educated guess it was outright goddamn unmannerly
TG: needs to get worked over by some stuffy prude at finishing school
TG: i dont know about that
TG: i dont know if you can keep up with me kid
TG: no offense
TG: theres just magic in these shoes and the coy gnome i ransacked wants them goddamn back
TG: ahahahahahaha
TG: i feel like i should be offering some visual rebuttal here
TG: you arent giving me any time though dammit
TG: oh yeah
TG: i keep forgetting i can time travel
TG: thats fine i guess
TG: see
TG: i cant compete with this
TG: but seriously what is the real plan here
TG: that has to do with not fucking around
TG: ok could you try to be somehow even less subtle when you hit on me thanks
TG: man
TG: nevermind
TG: no shit
TG: im going to infer that your species reproduces by having sex with a grub in a bucket or something
TG: am i close
TG: ok sorry
TG: back on point
TG: what are we doing
TG: ok
TG: sounds cool
TG: huh what an odd thing to say
TG: it demands no explanation whatsoever
TG: so how do i start making all this money
TG: tell me anyway
TG: dont know
TG: i never even looked at it
TG: k
TG: ok after all this hype you better be prepared to fucking dazzle me
TG: are you gonna bring it?
TG: awesome
TG: peace out t-z
TG: oh shit
TG: fuck
TG: i thought you were asleep
TG: not cool
TG: luring me into your cyber boobytrap with shitty clip art who told you my weakness
TG: obviously
TG: what
TG: oh god thats right
TG: you were the best troll
TG: i remember now
TG: yeah
TG: i mean
TG: in the most ironic and hilarious ways possible
TG: but that really shouldnt even need to be said
TG: it was months ago for me
TG: you did your bizarrely oblivious juggalo thing
TG: then bitched and moaned at me for ruining your religion or some horseshit
TG: like i guess a weird crisis in faith i dunno
TG: and then
TG: you kinda got over that i guess
TG: and we both proceeded to have one of the best rap-offs in the history of paradox space
TG: remember
TG: could be time shit
TG: you might not have had the conversation yet
TG: do you remember if you watched any videos
TG: from earth
TG: that i might have sent
TG: dude i was telling you
TG: youve got to check this out
TG: trust me itll lift your spirits shit will all make sense to you finally
TG: youll finally figure out who you are and why you worship all this ridiculous clown bullshit
TG: and also why your planet has faygo for some baffling reason
TG: actually no nevermind it doesnt explain that
TG: that still makes no damn sense
TG: but like
TG: the thing youre looking for
TG: your dark clownish salvation or whatever the fuck
TG: your mirthful messiahs
TG: ahahahaha i cant even type that without lmao
TG: anyway theyre here dude
TG: check it out
TG: http://tinyurl.com/MoThErFuCkInMiRaClEs
TG: it does bro
TG: my bloods red
TG: on earth class is sorted out by who can drop the most delirious flow
TG: no
TG: well yeah
TG: verbal pulse
TG: rap battles
TG: the kings of wordtech ascend to godhood and look down on us patriarchally like urban watermarks in the sky
TG: this is like
TG: our religion man
TG: its fucking serious business its like what our whole culture revolves around
TG: yeah well
TG: used to be dictated
TG: til the rapocalypse happened
TG: i still believe though
TG: in my heart so long as it keeps thumping the righteous beat
TG: subwoofing out devotion every which way
TG: that he will come
TG: our savior
TG: was foretold hed come after meteors show up to drop it like its hot
TG: and hed gather up the ashes of our civilization and lift it like its heavy
TG: fuck im tearing up my ishades are gonna fry
TG: hahahahaha
TG: douche
TG: if youre gonna spit that kind of bravado at me im just saying put it in rhyme
TG: lets hear what you got tooly mcsnoothole
TG: come on
TG: whatever dude
TG: deprivatize them
TG: just
TG: take whatevers in there
TG: that brorage lust youre feelin
TG: turn that bitch inside out like a broke ass millionaires pockets
TG: alright
TG: weird but alright
TG: you sound wound up
TG: but my gears are airtight
TG: steer clear a the seer and the knight if youre scared of unfair fights
TG: youll drop like the staircase impaired, seein em spareds a fair fuckin rare sight
TG: for poor eyes like that millionaire whos pockets i mocked earlier
TG: hes paradoxically me but richer and surlier
TG: broke as his sword before his stock picks skyrocketed
TG: worth more than all the chests lockpicked and gold croc bricks and boonbucks i pickpocketed
TG: fillin folios with millions im milkin to pad out my pockets
TG: more chock full than sad trollian villains cloggin my blocklist
TG: so thoughtful to popul-
TG: -ate my slate with propositions to copulate to a spate of hemoerotic hotpix
TG: which i posit you got shit of that nature in spades
TG: as my shades got you locked in
TG: spyin a guy whos eyed more cocks and dicks than i got clocks and they got ticks
TG: ahaha wow YES
TG: dont really understand that but yes
TG: ok hold that thought im gonna pull this fuckin sword out of the thing
TG: yes
TG: still no clue what this shit means but keep going
TG: holy shit
TG: what
TG: what the fuck
TG: oh god
TG: ok stop
TG: hahaha
TG: jesus
TG: ok maybe youre actually the worst troll
TG: im thinking none of that was actually ironic that was all pretty straightup wasnt it
TG: nevermind
TG: god dammit
TG: fuckin piece of shit sword
TG: wont goddamn budge probably useless anyway
TG: its a legendary piece of shit
TG: ok im kinda starting to wonder why youre bugging me now
TG: youre a fuckin creepy dude
TG: what
TG: you mean the guy who spent years beating my ass down with a puppet
TG: yeah i remember
TG: man
TG: im not that strong ok
TG: just cause i broke a cheap ass sword doesnt make me the fucking hulk
TG: what did you go around breaking a bunch of swords too
TG: how the fuck do you even wield a broken bow
TG: did you go around clubbing shit with the two halves
TG: whats it look like
TG: so am i
TG: bow down before your new king bitch
TG: please dont say this party started please dont say this party started
TG: god everything is about parties with you
TG: ok
TG: lets see some fine art then
TG: ok that
TG: is every bit as shitty as all your other drawings
TG: i like it though you dont gotta improve
TG: art skills are overrated
TG: its kind of weird though what the hell is actually going on here
TG: does this mean something
TG: yeah
TG: but
TG: why
TG: alright but
TG: i mean even if that made sense which it kind of doesnt
TG: karkat was saying how it was all a game and youre just flirtin and stuff
TG: and that we should quit it because he doesnt want you in my grill or me in yours or whatever
TG: well yeah thats what i thought too
TG: and really if we got no other reason keep rolling with it at least theres that one
TG: to piss him off
TG: im not saying i know for sure but it seems to me like
TG: my grill is your goddamn prison
TG: you are practically incarcerated in that fucker
TG: doing hard time on a bed of charcoal and lighterfluid
TG: privy to what i flame broil from below
TG: what im sayin is you got a front row seat to the brown side of my burger
TG: hows it smell btw
TG: yeah i thought so
TG: so is that whats going on
TG: is this some weird game involving flirtation and assassinations or whatever
TG: thats pretty much the most insulting thing possible to say im anything like that raving gulf of shit
TG: issues
TG: what are you talking about
TG: wow ok what does that have to do with me
TG: i dunno i guess maybe when i become future me
TG: fuck who cares
TG: like i even give a shit about being a hero whatever that even means
TG: im not seeing the problem here future me is awesome he can bail me out if he wants
TG: not gonna happen
TG: hey look at this change of subject going down
TG: about this comic
TG: are you saying im about to fall asleep
TG: why
TG: i dont feel tired
TG: could be rose waking me up again
TG: bonkin me with yarn or some shit
TG: can you see in my dreams
TG: too bad
TG: last time i promised rose id take off my shades and look in the sky for some reason
TG: youre gonna miss a hell of a show
TG: so i guess i have to summon davesprite too
TG: whys that
TG: huh
TG: ok
TG: yeah kinda
TG: didnt think this useless horseshit was boss grade loot to be honest
TG: ok see ya
DAVE: sup
DAVE: is that how you pronounce that
DAVE: what are welsh things doing in this game
DAVE: fuck yeah it is
DAVE: is this thing as pointless as i think it is or do i need it for something
DAVE: yeah thats what i figured
DAVE: fuck it ill just power through the rest of the game with the SORD.....
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: goddamn jpeg hero
DAVE: right here
DAVE: dude its long gone
DAVE: up in skaia now or something
DAVE: thrashing ill grinds on clouds
DAVE: yeah you got it
DAVE: so why wasnt this legendary pos in the sylladex you gave me
DAVE: did you chuck it after you alchemized it
DAVE: should i just chuck it too
DAVE: hes the denizen right
DAVE: isnt that like a greek god
DAVE: or roman or whatever
DAVE: what is greco roman shit doing in here you know what never mind
DAVE: whats the forge
DAVE: huh
DAVE: you mean jades volcano
DAVE: so do you know this stuff cause youre from the future or cause youre a sprite
DAVE: so now youre like
DAVE: a wise feathery asshole
DAVE: yeah i guess
DAVE: really
DAVE: there was no other way to get it out
DAVE: thats kind of retarded
DAVE: ok
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: that sounds about like something id do if i were you
DAVE: which i am
DAVE: so hey
DAVE: apparently im about to fall asleep
DAVE: yeah probably
DAVE: anyway monsters will show up soon and try to eat my sleeping corpse
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: so thats where you come in
DAVE: ok
DAVE: guess ill make myself comfortable here
DAVE: what do you mean
DAVE: where will you go
DAVE: oh yeah
DAVE: where do you think he is
DAVE: what happened to him in your timeline
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: ok good luck with that
TG: nak nak nak
TG: nak nak nak nak nak nak
TG: nakka nakka nak
TG: MY GLASSES ARE TALKING TO ME MY GLASSES ARE TALKING TO ME
TG: naknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknak
TG: hey
TG: welcome to the medium finally i guess
TG: ok i dont know what youre talking about it was probably just some horrorterror chirping at you during one of your nap bubble mindfucks
TG: its not the point i just wanted to say
TG: i just saw you
TG: yeah
TG: you appeared for a second
TG: shooting at an imp
TG: then you disappeared
TG: no you can kill them
TG: youll get better dont worry
TG: three places
TG: i remember seeing you twice before in different locations
TG: but at the moment im standing in the middle of this snowy goddamn field freezing my shit off
TG: just wanted to see if you were cool
TG: no i was
TG: this is future me
TG: one of the future mes that is
TG: yeah jade thats what future me means
TG: yeah
TG: its ok
TG: hey its pretty fucking cold
TG: so im gonna go some place warm be back in a while later
TG: ok im back
TG: an hour later
TG: an hour for me
TG: a second for you
TG: i ran around for an hour got my ass some place warm
TG: went back in time
TG: picked up where we left off
TG: yeah
TG: i guess im sorta used to it by now i dont think of hours going by the same way anymore
TG: i mean
TG: they are my hours but not everyone elses theyre kind of like private hours all to myself
TG: while everyone else is sort of in slow motion stuck in the thick of the alpha
TG: well yeah
TG: my thing is time yours is space
TG: pretty different things
TG: you GET things about space i dont
TG: or you will
TG: yup
TG: pretty believable since you lived on guam or wherever the fuck
TG: and also inside an active volcano
TG: well ive never seen it either now that i think about it
TG: no
TG: nah
TG: lavas better
TG: yeah it is lava and skeletal skyscrapers all melting and shit how is that not way cooler than
TG: snow and
TG: like
TG: more snow
TG: snows a big chilly carpet of nobody gives a shit
TG: like old man winter spread around his nasty mayonnaise and turned the landscape into his personal asshole sandwich
TG: when i look around all i see is the miles of unharnessed snowmen im just too damn cool to build
TG: whoa jade with the fucking haymaker
TG: i need to go look for my teeth on the canvas as soon as shit stops spinning and there stops being like ten of you
TG: time
TG: time
TG: time then shades
TG: time
TG: time/shades lets go
TG: oh my fucking god
TG: im not gonna play in the snow
TG: maybe you missed those credentials i flashed which clearly stated me being too cool for that
TG: like federally too cool
TG: my coolness is named after a dead president plus his middle initial to make it sound extra legit
TG: ok
TG: i thought you were going inside
TG: well at least make some damn clothes
TG: something warmer why dont you alchemize some shit
TG: blew up
TG: i completely understand everything about that practically entirely
TG: no dont bother john
TG: hes on like his fuckin
TG: wind mission or whatever
TG: getting all his ridiculous magic cyclone powers on and realizing his huge blowy destiny
TG: as the chump of shoosh
TG: almost
TG: we all start out somewhere
TG: remember how i was scrambling up that tower to get that egg like an idiot
TG: what the hell was i doing
TG: i was like goddamn pooh bear in a tree reaching up his fat fuckin pooh paw for some mother fuckin honey
TG: so even though im awesome now at one point i was plausibly likened to an autistic stuffed animal
TG: and you even knew what to do
TG: you told me how it worked all christopher robinning my ignorant ass about that egg
TG: but i was all like IM A LITTLE BLACK RAIN CLOUD BITCH WATCH ME CLIMB
TG: so maybe youre startin out with more sense than me
TG: in any case egbert lost his computer and game disc
TG: so he cant do anything for you anyways
TG: probably some shit like thats what happened
TG: but youre not completely screwed
TG: we just have to think outside the box here
TG: yeah honestly i figured wed have to do something like this
TG: so i guess here we are doing it
TG: well youre my server player remember
TG: i need you to deploy something first
TG: in my apartment
TG: in a few hours ill go back there and we can continue this
TG: yeah
TG: as in a few seconds
TG: im back at my place now
TG: yeah
TG: now
TG: deploy the intellibeam laserstation
TG: no it costs practically nothing
TG: check out how much ive got
TG: its mostly pretty stupid and useless
TG: but itll come in handy here
TG: it reads captcha codes
TG: yeah
TG: some are too garbled and complicated
TG: the human eye cant decipher them
TG: needs sophisticated scanning technology
TG: and artificial intelligence to figure it out
TG: yeah well
TG: thats why this is so dumb
TG: i guess some captchas are so incomprehensible cause the game thinks it would be too cheap to let you duplicate them
TG: like an anti piracy measure
TG: so the solution to the anti piracy measure is to override the anti spam measure
TG: well yeah thats what captchas are for
TG: and theyre on the back of cards for a really good reason
TG: cause god knows the last thing youd want was some web bot being able to figure out the code for like
TG: a potted plant
TG: that would be fucking mayhem
TG: but in order to effectively cheat here weve got to open pandoras spam box
TG: and release the laserstation into the world with its leering intellibeam
TG: now no captcha is safe youll have bots signing up for email accounts and duplicating potted plants and shit
TG: basically robots are in control now
TG: which is good news and bad news
TG: the bad news is theyre all pornbots and theyve got LOADS of provocative material theyre just dying to share with us
TG: thats also the good news
TG: whats it look like
TG: im duplicating my server disc
TG: nah i told you were not bothering john
TG: hes got shit to do
TG: ill just install it
TG: dont see why not
TG: we have to get creative here
TG: this games already so far off the rails what else is there to do but improvise
TG: well he was
TG: he got you in didnt he
TG: but now hes not
TG: been a change of plans
TG: time to roll with it
TG: yeah more or less
TG: i never really studied how it went down all that closely
TG: i just figured when the time came to sort it out the right thing to do would be obvious
TG: like it is now
TG: managing the loops is a balance of careful planning and just rolling with your in the moment decisions
TG: and trusting they were the ones you were always supposed to make
TG: by now im pretty used to having my intuition woven into the fabric of the alpha timeline
TG: yeah i know
TG: thisll be the disc i use for your connection
TG: while the original will stay bound to roses connection
TG: well technically
TG: i will be your server
TG: and past me will stay as roses server
TG: which is to say present me will
TG: the one in the black suit
TG: he can keep managing her for a while
TG: until she sorta checks out soon and becomes totally useless
TG: then he can start hopping around time like i did
TG: make a ton of money and stuff
TG: eventually become me
TG: and become your server player
TG: yeah see its not hard to get the hang of
TG: in the meantime ill kind of loiter around this timeframe to help you out for a while
TG: dont worry about it just some more future stuff
TG: now i need you to go downstairs
TG: im just going to cut right to the chase and upgrade your alchemiter so you can avoid a lot of bullshit
TG: ill give you some codes and you can punch cards and slip em into jumper blocks
TG: which are really the exact same codes you first gave me when we upgraded my alchemiter
TG: which seems like a hella long time ago
TG: yeah but it kind of literally is for me
TG: few days i guess
TG: whatever
TG: nak nak nak
TG: THE GLASSES ARE TALKING AGAIN
TG: naknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknak
TG: :V
TG: :(
TG: hey
TG: what just happened
TG: oh yeah
TG: so shes here then
TG: is she ok what was going on there
TG: i guess i should catch up with her
TG: i am
TG: oh ok time travels involved
TG: thats all you needed to say everythings cool and under control then
TG: weird
TG: and kind of boring
TG: i was in your dream room for a while spying on you
TG: being all creepy and dream duplicitous and shit
TG: whats with your book collection
TG: or
TG: dream book collection
TG: all your books are bizarre and terrible
TG: nah
TG: but yeah i understand defending your collection i guess if you were in my dream room and talking shit about my awesome dream portraits of dream stiller and dream snoop or whatever wed have to have a fucking talk
TG: oh
TG: yeah
TG: i did
TG: horrible things
TG: yeah
TG: it was like
TG: peering through the dark portal of an eldritch red lobster
TG: and scoping out its all you can eat seafood buffet
TG: and
TG: when i saw them
TG: their voices became clearer
TG: i couldnt really focus on anything specific
TG: but
TG: in totality
TG: im pretty sure it was
TG: like
TG: a plea for help
TG: no it was disturbing
TG: so i slapped my shades back on
TG: went and perved up some sleeping girls room to take my mind of it
TG: oh god why would i want that 
TG: im not about to get molested by calamari with fucking teeth
TG: use your powers and like
TG: stroke a mummys paw or some horseshit and open a dark channel
TG: tell them to keep their lecherous flagella to themselves
TG: whats that mean
TG: who cares if theyre getting killed
TG: theyre hideous and obnoxious
TG: oh ok cool
TG: oh shit youre kidding
TG: no really are you serious i didnt even notice
TG: fuck mind = blown
TG: ok
TG: what am i supposed to do
TG: like
TG: a treasure map
TG: why
TG: plot a course to what
TG: oh right the green sun ok
TG: wait sorry
TG: i mean the Green Sun my bad
TG: whats the deal with this thing
TG: i mean aside from giving jades dog his devil powers
TG: and by extension i guess jack
TG: yeah
TG: how big
TG: i need a sense of scale here
TG: is it like the size of our sun
TG: or bigger
TG: or is it only as big as like
TG: planet fucking jupiter
TG: ok thats pretty fucking big
TG: see how important that contextualization was now i know how fucking impressed i should be
TG: i mean hopy shit thats huge
TG: so ok i make a map to this thing
TG: with the help of a million rambunctious gross tentacle mutants
TG: and then i guess we go there for some reason
TG: why do we need a map
TG: cant they just
TG: tell us what direction its in
TG: point a spaceship that way
TG: blast off to adventure
TG: i can kind of get that time is messed up there
TG: with like loops and causality paradoxes and shit like that
TG: being the knight of time here
TG: not really sure why navigating the space would be a problem though
TG: space isnt my thing remember
TG: what is it like
TG: full of wormholes or something
TG: i thought you werent supposed to know shit about either
TG: seeing as youre the seer whatever that means
TG: fair enough
TG: so i take my map and fly to this thing
TG: ok you fly to it
TG: then what
TG: you mean with the quest youre sending him on
TG: is there anything you do thats not sending dudes on quests
TG: so hes got to get the cancer out of skaia right
TG: yeah
TG: so whats The Tumor do
TG: i mean the tumor
TG: jesus can we stop with the fancy colored text bullshit
TG: well ok you can keep doing it then
TG: ok cool what is it
TG: ok i wont say anything
TG: just tell me
TG: what the hell is a bomb doing in there
TG: first time for everything i guess
TG: seriously whered you get all this info
TG: did you get it all from the gods
TG: are these just a bunch of orders youre following
TG: what
TG: what you mean a troll
TG: sounds like a really credible dude sign me up for trusting everything he says
TG: oh so he knows everything
TG: even if he is omniscient which he probably isnt what if hes just lying
TG: whys he want to die
TG: wait
TG: what
TG: ok i get it now
TG: whoa fuck
TG: a suicide mission are you serious
TG: no bullshit thats not happening
TG: hey look suddenly everything we just talked about was useless because its time to make a plan that doesnt fucking suck
TG: oh
TG: haha yeah thats fine i guess
TG: those fuckers are all kinds of mad expendable
TG: way to leave me hanging there
TG: for someone whos saying lets cool it on the drama the whole i wont be coming back thing is a pretty theatrical bombshell
TG: for future reference
TG: yeah i know
TG: so when do i do my thing
TG: make this map
TG: which i guess is just like
TG: a solid black piece of paper
TG: this is going to be fucking stupid isnt it
TG: alright
TG: so
TG: dog it as long as possible
TG: then travel back to about now and go to sleep
TG: what
TG: no
TG: oh yeah terezi
TG: no shes cool
TG: its blossoming into an interspecies partnership in incredibly shitty cartooning
TG: what do you mean get her to trick someone into putting me asleep again
TG: when did that happen
TG: who did that
TG: god
TG: fuckin trolls
TG: too many of them who can even keep track of this shit
TG: which ones yours
TG: is it the absurd juggalo one that would be hilarious
TG: yeah see what i mean
TG: oh ok
TG: well im suddenly not interested so go talk to your fairy god troll
TG: ill be over here paving the way for your elaborate dream suicide
TG: when i feel like getting around to it i mean
TG: later
TG: ok
TG: what do you mean what
TG: but
TG: you know if im going to or not
TG: its lame for you to pretend theres any element of suspense here
TG: why dont you just tell me
TG: look i dont mind making the decision if thats whats going on here
TG: like doing the free will thing
TG: yes how would it ever stop being a thing
TG: being a things not something it ever stopped doing
TG: i just want to know whats really going on here
TG: before i decide to start choppin off the heads of outrageously good looking snoozing dudes
TG: ok i know but
TG: something about this doesnt add up
TG: who is this guy
TG: i dont remember sleeping on this bed
TG: or reaching the god tier im pretty sure thats something id remember
TG: so is he from the future
TG: does this mean later im going to have to put this ugly goddamn suit back on
TG: which i thought we both agreed id retired from the wardrobe forever
TG: and then go back in time and sleep in this bed and get killed by me right now
TG: do i have the stable loop right
TG: then what
TG: why wouldnt i be concerned about that
TG: if we make mistakes then dead daves start piling up
TG: and dead daves are the enemy remember
TG: says the sword holding guy whos about to add one to the pile
TG: who
TG: ok got it
TG: i wonder if this can finally be the conversation that doesnt deteriorate into a lot of bitching and moaning about her
TG: so if im understanding this
TG: this guy isnt from the future who came back to finish a loop
TG: and hes not from the past because id remember doing this
TG: so this isnt part of our timeline choreography at all
TG: must be from an offshoot timeline
TG: which means hes doomed
TG: ok so how did this happen where did we fuck up
TG: what exactly did you do
TG: yeah i remember
TG: that seems like a long time ago already
TG: what was that like more than a day for me chronologically
TG: ok but you didnt actually give me a choice
TG: you just flipped a coin
TG: ok stop that shit is probably like crack to you
TG: im not going to stand by and watch you fall prey to your own wild cherry apeshit apocalypse
TG: the arrangement being the coin flip thing
TG: thank god we did that otherwise wed be screwed
TG: i probably would have gone back in time and killed my own grandfather oh wait i never had one
TG: oh yeah
TG: twoface is a human batman villain whos half ugly and flips coins all the time to make evil decisions
TG: its ok flippin coins for reasons is still pretty badass i guess
TG: why dont you finish your story
TG: right exactly
TG: so like i said before i had no choice at all i picked some options and you flipped a coin
TG: not seein it
TG: i picked good heads to mean youd show me now
TG: bad heads to mean youd show me later
TG: you said it came up bad heads
TG: so i was like ok i can wait
TG: and i did for like a whole day
TG: and now here you are showing me
TG: did i miss something
TG: then
TG: this is kind of useless isnt it
TG: i thought you were bringing me back here to finish a stable time loop not murder a guy you punked whos gonna die regardless
TG: whats the fucking point of giving a doomed version of myself superpowers anyway
TG: its just the worst thing when you get morbid
TG: anyway maybe
TG: but i kind of doubt thats how it works i mean
TG: doomed means doomed doesnt it
TG: the loopholes are only temporary like look how davesprite turned out
TG: am i wrong in guessing that
TG: shouldnt you know better than me
TG: i dont know
TG: what does being a seer of mind actually mean
TG: oh ok its someone who asks a bunch of dumb riddles i figured it out already
TG: lets not get derailed here
TG: we were talking about a serious issue and im standing over my soon to be corpse while holding a fucking sword
TG: punishing
TG: i guess
TG: i dunno none of this is making for a very persuasive argument that i should kill doomed me
TG: see
TG: this shit youre doing now
TG: this is the morbid shit i was talking about
TG: its not anywhere near as endearing as you probably think
TG: even when you bracket smile after it
TG: like ok you said something fucked up but hey theres a cute face my heart just fucking melted
TG: ok yeah youre right i just got won back over totally
TG: i think
TG: this whole thing was a ruse
TG: and not even the funny kind that qualify as distactions
TG: i think you got my whole timeline there in front of you and you know damn well i have no intention of killing this guy ever
TG: and its just a big game you set up to watch me squirm over weird mortality issues while you giggle
TG: so
TG: i guess
TG: well played??????
TG: i dont know
TG: just one question
TG: and please just drop your fucking justice riddles and be honest
TG: do i ever make the god tier
TG: like the right way
TG: ok
TG: then cool i guess i can live without wearing a sweet windsock hoodie and making time tornadoes or whatever
TG: i was only bugging you about it cause you were being so vague
TG: alright then
TG: i guess thats enough of this horseshit time to move on right
TG: i dont even want to be around when he wakes up itll be weird and awkward
TG: no fuck no
TG: put your fucking death coin away jesus
TG: i am forbidding you from ever flipping that coin again when youre talking to me or even thinking about me
TG: what you didnt
TG: thats fucking idiotic
TG: you could smell a flea off a dogs balls
TG: this is bs
TG: so ok your coinflip of death was meaningless great to know
TG: is there anything else we need to do here
TG: i sent you the money i got all the fraymotifs tell me what is there thats left besides you jerking me around
TG: probably time we chill out for a while and i get back in sync with my teammates
TG: then i guess thats where ill go
TG: ok
TG: i mean
TG: im not even actually mad i just
TG: i dunno
TG: i still dont really get what you did
TG: was the trick really necessary
TG: it sounds like
TG: the splitoff was a result of both possible decisions i could have made
TG: and had fuckall to do with your coin or randomness or luck
TG: get what
TG: yeah
TG: and
TG: i obviously still dont know
TG: i dont know sounds like a riddle
TG: fuck it ill just say all of it
TG: i mean that is the answer right
TG: oh ok
TG: really well
TG: i know it biblically its an obscene nsfw spectacle
TG: means my skull is a bucket and my brains a plump fuckgrub
TG: oh do you
TG: is that what you were doing just now
TG: yeah no fuck
TG: man
TG: you are just
TG: some kind of knowitall arent you
TG: what else do you know
TG: like
TG: yeah because
TG: you didnt even look
TG: it was like
TG: schrodingers fucking coin
TG: and then
TG: it turned into schrodingers fucking dave
TG: yeah
TG: what
TG: yes perfect
TG: ok im going to torrent you another like negative billion artifact grists
TG: yeah
TG: now draw the conksuckiest boot you ever drew
TG: its the conksuckiest piece of fucking shit that ever still somehow qualified as a boot
TG: you just know imigrants were responsible
TG: yeah see what i mean
TG: well that was apparently pointless
TG: now what
TG: hello
TG: terezi
TG: whats up
TG: this is a dave out there whats up
TG: it wasnt a future dave he was from a while ago
TG: sorry you had to see that
TG: but dont worry it was just a doomed dave no big deal really
TG: i was swindled into splitting time paths along the way and that guy got the dead end of the stick
TG: ill be fine
TG: yes you are go ahead and be relieved
TG: nice
TG: yeah
TG: hes pretty much the guy in charge of random teleportation murders right now
TG: what
TG: my bro
TG: yeah jack killed him too
TG: not much to talk about
TG: this is some pretty serious existence threatening shit going down and some people are going to die i guess
TG: even crazy hard dudes like my bro slash weird covert biological ghost dad
TG: yeah roses too
TG: i thought john filled you in on the ectobiology stuff
TG: bottom line is were all related slimewise except you and me and him and rose pairways respectively
TG: makes the shipping chart pretty simple here hang on while i dig up that piece of shit karkat made
TG: where the fuck did that thing go
TG: fuck it never mind
TG: just imagine something ugly made by a jackass
TG: i guess
TG: meh it was a pretty bizarre relationship by any standard
TG: fightin off wave after wave of face pumicing puppet ass every day
TG: always being on guard for stealth attacks in the middle of the night while getting up to go to the fucking bathroom
TG: but i guess it all sorta amounted to some vague unspoken semblance of kinship
TG: if thats a thing
TG: like if honor among thieves is something then lets call it camaraderie among ironic rapping roof ninjas
TG: but thanks
TG: i thought about taking his sword
TG: when i was there
TG: but i couldnt
TG: couldnt really bring myself to try to pull it out it was too weird
TG: what
TG: you think
TG: well id like to
TG: but im still trapped in the chronologistics of this fuckin one man ballet
TG: there are loops outstanding and if i step out of line you get to see more bloody daves
TG: im getting pretty sick of it but i think itll be over soon
TG: then ill break out and ride linear the rest of the way i think
TG: once its time to put the end game in motion
TG: til then youre on your own for a while
TG: besides we cant beat him
TG: look what he did to bro and davesprite together
TG: im at the top of my echeladder with all the fraymotifs and i stand no chance
TG: johns even better than that even though he doesnt know it at the moment
TG: and he stands no chance either
TG: only thing we can do is hold out until the scratch
TG: guess i shouldnt really say
TG: since you sort of lead the way in making that plan
TG: yeah well
TG: suffice to say
TG: if we cant beat him
TG: all we can really do is exile him to a place where he cant teleport back
TG: which hopefully buys us some time
TG: to try to take out his power source in a crazy suicide mission
TG: kinda
TG: well
TG: youre about to do what youre about to do
TG: and im not going to tell you not to
TG: i wont do the bullshit troll thing and tell you what youre going to do and then just dare you not to
TG: while knowing damn well you will anyway
TG: so ill just say
TG: whats next is up to you
TG: and if later you want to talk about it
TG: im here
TG: hey
TG: christ
TG: youre a fan of one of my websites arent you
TG: what asshole gave you my chumhandle
TG: also what was your favorite thing i did you liked
TG: and what did you think was so great about it
TG: also
TG: asl???
TG: oh holy shit ok youre a troll
TG: only trolls say theyre six i dont know whats up with you and that dumb fake age
TG: makes no sense bye
TG: cool story
TG: ok so 2=6 awesome joke hahahaha
TG: or wait maybe it was just a waste of time
TG: you people think im made of the stuff
TG: what
TG: yeah
TG: i think
TG: im gonna shut off my phone now cya
TG: uh
TG: what
TG: the fuck
TG: i remember this
TG: i remember shutting off my phone and never talking to you again
TG: but
TG: im still talking
TG: whats going on
TG: no its a dream
TG: im asleep
TG: or am i
TG: what is going on here
TG: why
TG: bs
TG: i dont see anything out there
TG: oh sup
TG: looks like youre a fairy
TG: thats cool
TG: these arent my shades anymore
TG: john gave me these new ones for my bday
TG: i remember that
TG: and i wasnt wearing this shirt
TG: it was this one
TG: howd it get like that
TG: i cant
TG: wait
TG: i wasnt wearing this actually
TG: i was wearing this suit
TG: no wait
TG: it was a black one
TG: yeah
TG: and i was playing sburb
TG: thats right
TG: and then i went to sleep at some point
TG: which is why im asleep now
TG: but
TG: if im dreaming
TG: then why am i not awake as my dream self
TG: shit
TG: this wasnt the suit i was wearing
TG: it was this ugly fucking rag
TG: and i went to take a nap
TG: terezi said id reach god tier
TG: or i guess show me why i wouldnt
TG: did it work is this part of the process somehow
TG: so then
TG: its just a stupid pointless dream
TG: wait
TG: oh yeah
TG: i woke up
TG: and then
TG: welp
TG: so then
TG: im dead
TG: then this isnt a memory or a dream at all
TG: its the afterlife
TG: ok
TG: what is going on over here then
TG: is this some disturbing ghost hallucination should i start slapping myself or what
TG: i dont remember this
TG: fuck
TG: lucky bastard
TG: so then i guess terezi tricked me
TG: it would have been cool to know if picking one option would definitely kill me pointlessly so yeah
TG: but i guess i kept giving her shit about it and i knew she was kind of crazy and morbid anyways so whatever
TG: is
TG: bro dead there
TG: like in reality
TG: like thats a thing that really happened
TG: also
TG: is reality still a thing that means something can that be a question on the table too
TG: well
TG: dammit
TG: what did i do wrong
TG: aside from getting my ass killed in the most retarded way possible
TG: whats he doing
TG: alpha me
TG: i am him
TG: i dunno
TG: yeah
TG: sorta
TG: maybe
TG: ok
TG: am i talking to someone there
TG: who
TG: probably
TG: terezi i guess
TG: i dunno
TG: would she do that
TG: was i
TG: so
TG: im just one dead dave offered up to the time god
TG: what about the other dead daves
TG: uh
TG: i think
TG: im up to my neck in dave already
TG: just being one
TG: still doesnt seem right though
TG: why are you even here like why are you showing me this
TG: but like
TG: if im seeing this
TG: shouldnt i be able to do something about it
TG: or stop it from happening or
TG: i dont know like anything to keep helping my friends
TG: what do i do
TG: where are we now
TG: oh so this is the trollplanet
TG: pretty cool not really what i pictured
TG: i dont know its more subdued
TG: i pictured a lot more mayhem like
TG: a bunch of trolls flying around in little grub pods constantly screaming at each other through bullhorns shaped like buckets
TG: hahaha
TG: can we not go to those parts
TG: awesome
TG: so what am i supposed to do now that im dead
TG: what is like
TG: the primary activity here
TG: that ghosts get their shit worked up over
TG: like
TG: where are the fucking hauntoffs at is what im asking
TG: boring
TG: just kidding that sounds cool
TG: what else
TG: it isnt
TG: ha
TG: haha
TG: i bet you meant a laugh a whole lot less shitty than that
TG: yeah sure
TG: well
TG: how about later
TG: not that that doesnt sound cool but i kind of want to just go home
TG: and i guess chill for a while cause i guess it was all a bit much
TG: if thats ok and i guess also possible
TG: aw hell no
TG: is this who i think this is
TG: holy shit
TG: dude
TG: are those sick fires youre packing there
TG: you best not be bringin that fire into my bubble less you plan on dropping that shit
TG: i am your general fucking practitioner and doctors orders are to shut up and burn down my goddamn office
TG: ill break your brittle ass like a graham cracker and well roast smores over the flaming debris have i made myself clear
TG: dude
TG: gross
TG: so aradia just so were clear
TG: this is like a hellbubble right
TG: its my eternal punishment to have shitty rapoffs with this tool forever is that it
TG: i guess i had it coming for a flagrant lifetime spent being unbelievably fucking incredible at rap and just about practically everything else
TG: except not dying
TG: so is he dead
TG: he looks dead
TG: what about you
TG: you dont look dead
TG: are you dreaming
TG: so
TG: youre not dead
TG: oh my fucking god
TG: what do you mean what
TG: we just got done talking and agreed it would be awesome if you didnt bother me for a while
TG: you know like while i guess i grieved over this brutally murdered rad family member or something
TG: it was five seconds ago
TG: so youre officially going nonlinear with me then
TG: were just forfeiting all rhyme or reason to this unmitigated clusterfuck is that it
TG: whoops ok in the future ill try not to pitch any sort of dramatics while brooding over the cadavers of slaughtered loved ones
TG: no
TG: puppets arent cool theyre shitty small fake people who haunt your dreams and grin like permanent assholes
TG: i was making a joke about being all broken up about it
TG: a guy can be sad and make jokes at the same time
TG: exactly
TG: i said we agreed youd leave me alone to grieve
TG: didnt say whether i actually would or actually am
TG: i am grieving to the max like a widow on dead husband island
TG: behind these chill as fuck shades my face is having this crazy attack of the sads
TG: my rue is fucking bananas cant you tell
TG: the truth is a mystery
TG: tucked behind the pursed lips of a shitty riddler
TG: they will be loosened only when presented with the conundrous grandeur of rigid insoluble puzzlecock
TG: im sorry you are so flustered by the mere mention of glittering mythical cryptodick it honestly makes me think youre not ready for the truth
TG: its pretty simple
TG: im just thinkin about how im gonna take this sword
TG: filthiest thing you ever said
TG: forget it
TG: pulling swords out of things isnt how i roll
TG: im not john remember
TG: im not a hero
TG: my bro was
TG: john is
TG: im not
TG: no
TG: fine its a title we inherit as phlegm babies or whatever but what have i done to earn it
TG: pretty much nothing but horsing around through time and swindling retarded alligators out of their life savings
TG: if that swords coming out of his chest its coming out clean
TG: taking it vertically means drawing more blood
TG: but horizontally means a clean break
TG: check it
TG: no fuck that
TG: im a lie my ass right down here for a while looking slightly less cool than i make myself out to be ordinarily
TG: that is basically what i just did isnt it
TG: thats what im doing here im making a point of makin every little thing take place what was once mentioned in passing no matter how seemingly trivial or pointless
TG: thats how all the best adventures get strung together
TG: you havent heard me bleat like a goat for ironically humorous purposes yet have you
TG: that was something that was mentioned at some point by someone i forget when or why
TG: i bet you are on goddamn pins and needles waiting for that arent you
TG: no
TG: fuck that
TG: no
TG: fuck you
TG: go away
TG: what
TG: i dunno
TG: why are you even talking to me anyway
TG: aside from the fact that several hours from now you apparently forget i dont need consolation and oughta be left alone
TG: oh
TG: bitten
TG: what
TG: that sure sounds like a dumb way to say a thing
TG: almost egbertian in elegant stupidity
TG: the t in egbertian is soft like shhhhh
TG: why would i get mad at you
TG: ok
TG: but yeah i guess its about time you showed me whats up with my allegedly futile god tierification
TG: how long ago was it that you did your coin flip thing i dont even remember
TG: i was getting sure you were just bullshitting me and had no intention of ever mentioning it again
TG: for what
TG: before what happens
TG: you mean god tiering
TG: does something go wrong
TG: thats practically unthinkable
TG: but i mean ok we can talk about your troll problem but this is pretty important here
TG: the god tier thing and whether i can actually do it or not
TG: it might be kind of hard to tell on account of me chilling face down on the pavement and also because downplaying feelings is the chief rule of cool but im pretty pissed about this
TG: which is weird
TG: no its not weird to be mad its just weird it feels like im the only one who is
TG: and the only one even contemplating taking jack on
TG: even among your group of irate gnashing shitheads
TG: what
TG: well ok
TG: and that would be a bitchin line to switch the subject to start talkin about your complicated problems but i kinda wasnt done
TG: but ok i mean isnt that what heroes should be doing
TG: working to take down the bad guy without a whole lot of this fuckin grandiloquence and these huge sweeping plans that got nothin to do with fighting him
TG: like always biding our time and tiptoeing around the unbeatable god boss
TG: johns too nice to get mad
TG: rose spends all her time calculating
TG: too focused on machiavellian ploys of sabotage to try anything drastic
TG: jade is
TG: i dont even know
TG: probably more a liability if she got it in her head to take him down
TG: if anything id bet she just needs protection
TG: im just wondering
TG: when does someone actually step up
TG: jacks got shit to pay for
TG: yeah i guess
TG: i guess it has been on my mind
TG: maybe i am supposed to be a hero and rise to the occasion because there seems to be this little persistent voice in my head nagging me about it
TG: insisting someones gotta pay
TG: and its hard for me to disagree
TG: what things
TG: im pretty sure i dont even have an exile
TG: ive never heard any voices or anything
TG: anyway you dont need a voice in your head to tell you this shit is
TG: just like
TG: so completely illegal
TG: wait
TG: why did i just say that stupid thing i said
TG: no i mean
TG: ok that came out wrong
TG: what were we talking about again
TG: right
TG: someone has to make him pay
TG: cant let him just go unpunished
TG: if i can figure out how to reach the god tier maybe i can be the one to throw him into the slammer
TG: slammer means jail
TG: you call it the slammer when youre extra angry at crimes
TG: are you taking notes on this important principle?? jesus get a fucking pen
TG: or some chalk or whatever
TG: wait
TG: fuck
TG: what
TG: no
TG: i know it doesnt
TG: im just saying
TG: what am i even saying here
TG: shit
TG: ok forget the slammer stuff that was stupid
TG: it is about justice though
TG: and since no one else seems to give a shit about that it apparently falls in my jurisdiction now
TG: not just going after jack
TG: but all the mutinous agents responsible for crimes
TG: holy shit why do i care about THAT suddenly
TG: anyway thats more shit that popped into my head just now
TG: so
TG: ok
TG: not really
TG: no
TG: anyway
TG: its not like being mad about this and hankering for justice is even the only irrational thing im currently hot and bothered about
TG: i have other duties to attend to
TG: ive got to explode this ridiculously illegal edifice oh my god what are these words im saying
TG: never mind
TG: oh
TG: yeah
TG: thats gotta be what im talking about
TG: probably
TG: i need to shut up now
TG: im sounding like an idiot and my head is starting to hurt
TG: why dont we talk about your thing now
TG: what justice thing do you have to do
TG: yes
TG: just please tell me your justice problem and make me stop saying stuff
TG: farewell
TG: no i mean
TG: god damn it im not leaving
TG: farewell is not even a thing i would ever say jesus what am i a victorian poet
TG: can you show me a little respect and assume any time i say something stupid it just means im temporarily being inexplicably retarded
TG: thats what a real friend would do
TG: thank you
TG: that sounds awesome
TG: justice problems
TG: oh shit are you fucking serious
TG: no i got that theyre like your alien death lawyers who were sorta like bounty hunters in olden times pretty simple to decipher through context
TG: she
TG: ok i cant even make little interrogative quips to grease the wheels of your monologue
TG: spidertroll
TG: youve decided to take her down then
TG: you dont sound that psyched about it
TG: are you feeling guilty
TG: like second guessing whether she deserves it
TG: hasnt she done enough terrible shit to warrant legislaceration
TG: are you sure about that
TG: there is no john vs dave thing though
TG: are you going to stop me too then
TG: hunt me down and lawyerviscerate me for my own good
TG: are you saying that i wont make god tier or i wont be strong enough if i do
TG: what
TG: lame motion overruled the judge wants to see where this is going
TG: ok fine
TG: we can keep obsessing over your fucked up kismesister if you want
TG: do you think she stands a chance against him
TG: then whats the big deal
TG: why not let her go get her shit ruined by jack and let justice happen that way
TG: so why dont you go do it
TG: you mean you cant beat her in a fight
TG: i thought trolls were all about gratuitous murderings
TG: are
TG: you asking me to reassure you about that
TG: cause i seriously dont have a clue
TG: i dont understand
TG: i thought you were insane kinds of apeshit over the macabre stuff
TG: like being all cutesy about executions and smelling cherry blood and such things contrived to get a guy feeling vaguely uncomfortable
TG: was that all an act
TG: of course the fuck not
TG: didnt you say youve killed people before
TG: ok
TG: id like to help you out but i dont know what advice i should be giving
TG: to a member of a murderous species whos gunshy on going off to justicemurder a murderhappy murderer whose done lots of murders
TG: it feels pretty weird and inappropriate for me to be the one to tell you fuck yes go for it shes got this huge murder with her name on it anyways and its cruising right at her down comeuppance boulevard
TG: so i dont know
TG: do you want me to tell you to be a better human
TG: or to be a better troll
TG: alright well all ill say is
TG: maybe if you kill her at least we can finally stop obsessing over her
TG: why dont you just do what you think you have to do
TG: and ill do the same
TG: speaking of which
TG: these time shenanigans completely blindsided us they practically never even happen
TG: so i hang up now with future you and then start pestering present you about it is that how it works
TG: and i make sure not to reference anything said here to keep it simple
TG: except like in an offhand way thatll seem retroactively logical to your future self
TG: ie you right now
TG: if for no other reason than itd be boring as hell to rehash it
TG: does luck actually matter
TG: heres one for you
TG: its a whopper
TG: are you ready
TG: this huge fuckin whopper im about to just say
TG: what
TG: no no
TG: ok first do you even have burger kings out in the fucking woods
TG: why do you reference things that obviously arent in the woods like terrible burgers
TG: there is
TG: ok whatever
TG: im talking about a dream i just had
TG: i mean it was a doozy like psychologically speaking
TG: doozy is a slightly dumber word than whopper
TG: it was absurdly heavy handed my subconscious was really slathering it on
TG: like whatever tangy sludge the king himself squirts on his bargain patties
TG: its possible that i dreamt it ironically i dunno
TG: i figured youd be interested in hearing about it its every bit as thick and juicy as a half pound of sizzling grade A premium ok this is stupid weve got to get burgers out of this conversation
TG: are you busy
TG: cool listen to this
TG: no but this one is too good not to put under the microscope with your whole precocious psychotherapy shtick its almost laughably symbolic of all my mental problems assuming i actually have those
TG: its grotesquely pregnant with meaning
TG: all gestating at least 8 gooey octuplets thrashing around in an undulating belly full of mind slime
TG: no look
TG: i just want your professional take on how many things in my dream symbolize dicks
TG: yeah thats a given but i didnt even dream about puppets this time
TG: i know
TG: it was so much more relaxing and enjoyable
TG: it was about me dying repeatedly
TG: i was in this dark place surrounded by this big flock of crows
TG: god this is so generically morbid
TG: im sorry in advance for exposing you to my unconscious minds retarded cliches
TG: well obviously i knew the birds were just black screaming sky dongs just hear me out
TG: i kept dying
TG: there kept being these traps like i would go one way and get my head chopped off
TG: or go another way and get stabbed or whatever
TG: and every time i died the dream reset itself and i was standing there alive and ready to try to escape again
TG: but each time i would be watching myself from the vantage point of a different crow
TG: like i was the crow all squawking around in circles like a macabre flapping douche
TG: and i would always watch myself try to do something different to dodge the trap but i always ended up dead
TG: you mean maybe its about anxiety over maintaining my blogs
TG: or that my beats might not be ill enough
TG: and then we crack up laughing cause we both know theyre fresher than your moms change of drawers and tighter than when shes wearin them
TG: please its not like shes my mom i can visualize her choice ass all i want without it gettin much more than moderately uncomfortable for everyone involved
TG: about what
TG: uh
TG: this isnt the first time youve insinuated were related what is up with that
TG: no
TG: i mean
TG: im not sure
TG: i feel like youve brought it up before which is kind of weird but now i dont know
TG: i think im getting this weird deja vu thing where i was sure we talked about this
TG: forget it
TG: ok
TG: so i kept dying and kept being crows and stuff
TG: and then i started to notice something coming from the sky
TG: it was this faint eerie singing and i look up and theres nothing there just darkness
TG: what did you read
TG: what the fuck sort of crackpot psychology text would say something like that
TG: so then youre consulting astrology books now
TG: oh my fucking god will you put that away
TG: theres not even much more to it
TG: i looked up into the sky
TG: didnt see anyone singing
TG: but even though the sky was black i could see the sun
TG: it was bright as hell even through my shades
TG: so i flapped my wings and flew up away to it like a fucking piece of garbage
TG: and thats it
TG: no
TG: not in the sense that it was a dark sacrificial zoology mission
TG: it was more like somewhere to go besides watching myself die a lot from the vantage of a feathery murder of dumb shitty birds
TG: what the fuck are you talking about
TG: ok somethings wrong
TG: this whole conversation is falling apart this isnt how it originally went at all
TG: this happened months ago
TG: does this mean im dead
TG: stop it
TG: this is so sick you using the dream bubble bullshit to pick apart my psyche
TG: am i dead or asleep
TG: god dammit
TG: yeah right
TG: i dont know
TG: i remember waking up here
TG: after getting shot
TG: then the cage bunny came
TG: he gave us the bomb
TG: whered he go anyway
TG: the bunnys a she
TG: dumb
TG: we were talking about who should go
TG: no
TG: wait
TG: wasnt i going to go
TG: is that what happened did i go and now im dead
TG: whats not quite
TG: that i didnt go or that im not dead
TG: no
TG: sure
TG: i did that
TG: because i wanted to
TG: and because i was supposed to
TG: yeah i saw my future self fighting him so obviously that had to happen or else id be dead anyway
TG: without even getting the satisfaction of standing up to him
TG: hard to explain
TG: with all the time shit going on
TG: i dont try to understand your light shit do i
TG: havent we had this conversation already
TG: its jogging i guess
TG: its manboobs are jiggling a little
TG: what
TG: what am i really supposed to say
TG: hey were gonna hunt frogs til you shoot me through the jack
TG: then i die and youve got to make out with me
TG: that kind of changes how the whole thing goes doesnt it
TG: what does that even mean
TG: wtf
TG: aspd
TG: oh no
TG: this conversation just got bumrushed by a mudslide of fucking awful
TG: you dont know anything
TG: about what i was feeling or what happened on lofaf
TG: you were all pavement faced and babbling your throefester speak and flipping off the shit with your own crazy deathwish thing why do you think you know what was going through my head
TG: youre just assuming and throwing around psyche buzzwords like aspd complex disorder
TG: in your case probably
TG: its some delirious biznasty alright
TG: yes ima authorize a GOD DAMN you may swipe it at the door to check yourself into the burn ward
TG: nah those are kept in emergency reserve for yo mama jokes from the 90s
TG: anyway
TG: im telling you if i said anything at all about it she probably doesnt even fire her gun once and all im doing is dragging her into a doomed timeline with me
TG: none of this is that big a deal
TG: i just mentioned the basics to her
TG: that id stop time traveling soon
TG: break out of the loops
TG: not have to wonder all the time if i was taking a wrong turn and dooming everybody
TG: i was never that cool with this
TG: you know how you turned out to be this incredibly shitty seer of light and basically failed at that in every way imaginable
TG: well maybe i never wanted to be a knight of time
TG: maybe id rather just be like
TG: the dave of guy
TG: you know just some dude
TG: i guess not
TG: guess i failed my quest then
TG: so im like
TG: now what bitches
TG: to nobody in particular i guess
TG: yes those exact bitches
TG: oh yeah
TG: i remember that now
TG: then i guess thats what happened
TG: i delivered the bomb and now i must be dead
TG: is that wrong
TG: because i made the map so i know how to get there better
TG: ok if you remember it all so clearly why are you grilling me on this shit
TG: will you just tell me whats going on
TG: well i am
TG: because i should
TG: or should have
TG: man what the fuck is going on
TG: am i dead or are you dead or what
TG: uh
TG: oh yeah
TG: we were trying to figure out a way to detach the moon
TG: so i could pilot it out there
TG: fly it into the sun
TG: but the chain was huge
TG: couldnt think of how to break it
TG: then out of nowhere this sword appears in the thing
TG: so im thinking obviously i have to break the sword somehow
TG: because thats all i fucking do is break swords
TG: but as im thinking of how to do it i put my hand on it
TG: and it just snaps off with this comical shattering noise
TG: like i just fucked up some priceless shit in the louvre
TG: see like that
TG: like i did again just there with my hand
TG: cause of dreambubbles
TG: remember when that happened
TG: then i took it and sliced the chain
TG: like this
TG: damn
TG: it still cuts like its plowing through a shaft of boneless zombie meat
TG: whoops
TG: yeah
TG: so then
TG: the moon started drifting away
TG: and i was going to fly up
TG: and take it to the sun
TG: and i said something to you
TG: or i was going to
TG: like say bye or something
TG: but you were just standing there not saying anything
TG: holding that ball of yarn
TG: and then
TG: oh
TG: god thats right
TG: come on
TG: knocking me out so you can steal the suicide mission
TG: god dammit
TG: that is so trite
TG: its like
TG: heres how bad this is
TG: were are basically bruce willis and ben affleck from johns shitty crappy movie
TG: you made this even more armageddon than it already was
TG: sealing me in the air lock so i can go home to liv tyler and have the most terrible babies with her
TG: the bunny or the actress
TG: you not knocking me out with a ball of fucking yarn is fucking what
TG: this probably comes close but that doesnt make it not lame as hell
TG: its cool you are so tickled by this i hope it brought you a lot of rad laughs on your way to go fucking explode
TG: so thats it
TG: im actually lying here on derse asleep
TG: and you went out there and blew up the sun
TG: and now youre dead and im dream chilling with your smug ghost
TG: so youre not dead
TG: then youre dreaming
TG: what youre taking a little nap on the moon in the middle of nowhere
TG: ok
TG: so all those questions you asked me
TG: getting me to remember
TG: you were just stalling me werent you
TG: so i wouldnt wake up and try to stop you
TG: this sucks
TG: could you just please turn the thing around and come back
TG: we agreed id do it though
TG: or at least you pretended to agree
TG: just before going into a major league wind up with your nap yarn
TG: sports
TG: all im saying is
TG: no one likes a basketball hog
TG: i just think you should know
TG: that in the athletic arena of competitive achievement
TG: its a widely known fact that cherry picking posers get showered in nothin but boos
TG: you dont gank the rock and steal the big mans thunder on his raucus drive to the hole
TG: is that the sort of ignominy you want
TG: see you didnt consider sports you never consider the sports
TG: and yet
TG: such has been whats happened
TG: it like the tight end was going long down the yard in sudden death
TG: its me im the tight end
TG: and the quarterback sniped the fieldgoal just before the nfl buzzer went off
TG: the greedy qb is you
TG: but instead of winning the gold sports prize you just fucking die and nobody cares and it didnt mean anything
TG: the football prize
TG: no come on
TG: its called the bruce bombardi trophy or something
TG: for best pile squad
TG: and even though youre dead all these fat millionaires in helmets just leap on your corpse anyway and pile up and i mean WAY up
TG: the sport pile doesnt stop from getting taller
TG: what do you care youll be dead like the mission thieving poser you are
TG: yes poser it should be my torso getting pulverized by that avalanche of overpaid beefcakes and you know it
TG: there obviously stopped being a difference between those things the question is offensive
TG: almost as offensive as you stalling me while you peel out of here in your dumb moon
TG: yeah but i dont know how to wake back up is the thing
TG: how do i wake back up
TG: ok then do it
TG: but this was my mission
TG: that doesnt make sense
TG: why would they drag me into it just to have me make a map and then let you ditch me
TG: theyve obviously been gunning for me too
TG: why do you think that
TG: but i dont want you to die
TG: this isnt right
TG: so you admit you were stalling with all that bullshit
TG: what do you mean
TG: ............
TG: what
TG: sure
TG: but
TG: if im promising not to chase you down then theres not really any hurry to wake up
TG: nah ill stay asleep a while
TG: what did you want me to tell john
TG: what
TG: no what
TG: whos this douche dag
TG: i mean bag
TG: im stuttering this dude is making me nervous

TG: dude are you an actual juggalo or not
TG: hahahahaha
TG: do you really not know what im talking about
TG: ahaha
TG: i cant even tell if youre trying to troll me with this or if you actually are having some weird emotional problem
TG: ok im telling you
TG: you need to watch this video
TG: the song isnt even supposed to be released for another year or something
TG: but i got it from an inside source
TG: this is as hot as it gets
TG: hang on lemme dig it up
TG: none of that really meant anything but ok
TG: also you have me confused for somebody else we never talked
TG: i guarantee i would have remembered you
TG: thats cool juggalo guy who i still cant quite tell is ironic about this or not
TG: but like i said either way its all good
TG: what
TG: what fears
TG: oh god
TG: did my bro put you up to this
TG: i should have guessed he might have a hand in some of these shitty trolling escapades
TG: hahaha jesus
TG: you are fucking insane
TG: so
TG: my bros idiotic ventriloquist dummy is responsible for this schizophrenic bullshit
TG: is that what youre saying
TG: what else does he say
TG: welp
TG: that sounds about right
TG: better do what he says dude
TG: hahahahahahahaha
TG: you are either literally an insane psychopathic murderer or some kind of trolling savant
TG: time to block you now but lets do this again ok
TG: holy shit
TG: uh
DAVE: hahaha oh god
DAVE: oh my god we are never going to stop fucking with each other are we
DAVE: even without computers
DAVE: yo terezi weve got a grim reaper too
DAVE: shit isnt that novel
DAVE: i mean i think even a civilization full of the laziest sons of bitches are gonna make up a myth figure for death
DAVE: like oooh watch OUT death is coming for you hes got like
DAVE: a SKULL and shit
DAVE: i basically have no fucking imagination that sounds badass to me
DAVE: wait wait no how about hes got a BLACK ROBE too
DAVE: and a fuckin scythe to fuckin slash at you with in case you didnt die all the way or whatever
DAVE: daaaaaamn now youre talking bro
DAVE: lets go ahead stick that in our culture forever
DAVE: hell yes
DAVE: dude chill out we just got hornswoggled is all
DAVE: man what the hell even happened on this meteor anyway
DAVE: actually dont even tell me
DAVE: are you actually
DAVE: wait
DAVE: really
DAVE: ok
DAVE: i dont really have any orders to give though
DAVE: except for karkat to shut the hell up because that horseshit is more obnoxious in person than i ever imagined
DAVE: aw yeah
DAVE: i got sicknasty logistics up my sleeve
DAVE: i just call them stics fyi which is how you know im way savvy about them
DAVE: most of the stics im fine tuning atm involve rap though i should warn you
DAVE: but dave what if that dope as hell plan falls through i can hear you ask
DAVE: plan b
DAVE: involves drawing some shitty cartoons
DAVE: and not giving a fuck about stuff
DAVE: hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
DAVE: rose i told you this dude is fucking incredible
DAVE: whoa really
DAVE: wait
DAVE: shes dead too
DAVE: you guys are so messed up
DAVE: wait has the juggalo troll been giving you guys fits like this or something
DAVE: like this is a thing
DAVE: like a pattern
DAVE: oh man one of you has got to sit me down and tell me what actually happened here it all just sounds fuckin amazing in sort of the stupidest way possible
DAVE: i mean like personal tragedies notwithstanding
DAVE: not really
DAVE: oh wait
DAVE: against all odds i sorta do
DAVE: mine actually did do that once
DAVE: when i was really young
DAVE: he made this stupid leather bib for me out of a goddamn horse
DAVE: for the ironies obviously
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: what
DAVE: well shit
DAVE: thats a hell of a mystery no one thought was a mystery and didnt even really need solving
DAVE: but damn if it didnt just get solved so nice work
DAVE: whos this guy
DAVE: is he dead
DAVE: what is he the mayor of anyway
DAVE: it kinda looks like he just made that sash himself
DAVE: hey
DAVE: anyone seen terezi around
DAVE: we were gonna do a thing
DAVE: but shes not around and not answering my messages
DAVE: on any one of the probably ten thousand computers lying around that they would show up on
DAVE: yes a thing
DAVE: shut up
DAVE: what about you have you seen her
DAVE: are you serious
DAVE: of course not
DAVE: i havent seen that guy at all since the first day we got here
DAVE: not once
DAVE: talk about an elusive juggalo
DAVE: probably like the shyest fuckin juggalo of all time
DAVE: im pretty sure only karkats seen him
DAVE: dont expect him to rat him out either because of the "morail" junk
DAVE: moirail?
DAVE: mwah rail...
DAVE: alien words
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: i mean i bet you think youre imparting some really obscure cultural fact about trolls
DAVE: but really if a human said to another human
DAVE: "hey man can you tell me where your best clown friend is hiding so i can go chainsaw him to death"
DAVE: just fyi that would probably be bad form too
DAVE: i dunno its been a year already i think hes really intent on hiding
DAVE: and hanging on to those dead bodies
DAVE: hes probably scared to death of you at this point anyway
DAVE: maybe you should just let it go
DAVE: rose back me up
DAVE: interpersonal
DAVE: wait
DAVE: are you saying this is like
DAVE: a spade quadrant thing
DAVE: is she trying to be his kismet fish
DAVE: well if she hates him isnt that what that means
DAVE: haha no im not shes cool
DAVE: look shes being cool about it
DAVE: see????
DAVE: yeah see i knew there had to be a perfectly harmless and unerotic explanation
DAVE: got it
DAVE: so what are you up to in here
DAVE: whats with all these books
DAVE: hell yeah
DAVE: we looted one of them for the can town project
DAVE: i told you about can town didnt i
DAVE: well
DAVE: the thing about can town
DAVE: and all there really is to say about can town is
DAVE: its awesome
DAVE: the end???
DAVE: fu
DAVE: so
DAVE: what is the point of this research
DAVE: i thought you pretty much already knew the situation
DAVE: since you can see the future
DAVE: yes you can
DAVE: you totally can
DAVE: no thats totally dumb
DAVE: i could know things about the future if i time traveled and found out first hand
DAVE: nobodys mistaking that about me im a time traveler not a fuckin fortune teller its simple as shit
DAVE: ok whatever
DAVE: nice
DAVE: uh
DAVE: now?
DAVE: yeah that would be pretty legit of us
DAVE: ok i didnt really catch any of that bullshit cause i wasnt listening
DAVE: im gonna make myself a cup of coffee and get primed to listen to you saying a lot of stuff like that
DAVE: do you want some
DAVE: kanaya?
DAVE: ok
DAVE: ...
DAVE: this fuckin thing
DAVE: where did you even unearth this piece of shit from
DAVE: oh ok there it goes
DAVE: two hot revitalizing cups of shitty coffee
DAVE: fresh out of the weird pod
DAVE: why do we even drink this shit
DAVE: i guess just cause this thing is here
DAVE: like somehow the temptation is even stronger because the coffee sucks?
DAVE: dunno how the fuck that works
DAVE: wish there was such a thing as apple juice on troll world
DAVE: could go for a bottle of aj
DAVE: i wonder if theres any booze squirreled away on this meteor
DAVE: kinda feels like we should be drinking our asses off here
DAVE: no adults nothing to do
DAVE: thats what you do without adults right
DAVE: get wasted all the time?
DAVE: wait what the fuck am i saying trolls dont even have adults
DAVE: well they do
DAVE: but theyre all in outer space being insane badasses
DAVE: i guess they do have the stupid nanny monsters
DAVE: do the monsters give a shit if they get wasted
DAVE: what
DAVE: oh
DAVE: off the shit is how
DAVE: all being like
DAVE: in cups and everything
DAVE: so whats with the big book youre writing in
DAVE: is that more wizard fan fiction
DAVE: so its like
DAVE: your nigh unreadable gamefaq
DAVE: in tome form
DAVE: you sure like to write big game guides
DAVE: i guess
DAVE: ehh
DAVE: chances of that seem pretty remote
DAVE: ok totally sold on that suddenly
DAVE: on account of not caring
DAVE: so tell me about the new session
DAVE: what is there to know
DAVE: and most importantly
DAVE: how is everything going to go wrong this time
DAVE: ok but i thought the whole point of this
DAVE: the scratch thing
DAVE: is it gave us a chance to still win
DAVE: but youre saying the new session has a fault too?
DAVE: ok
DAVE: which is what
DAVE: weird
DAVE: why would these alt universe players fuck up in such an obvious and stupid way
DAVE: didnt you say at some point that not prototyping anything would be really bad
DAVE: still waiting to hear how this is in any way an improvement on all the shit we just escaped from
DAVE: jade has our battlefield right
DAVE: so she shows up and drops it in skaia
DAVE: and then we take the result of all that damn frog breeding we did and stick the thing in there somehow
DAVE: and we sit back and wait for it to do its huge ribbit or whatever
DAVE: and were golden
DAVE: is that going to be a problem
DAVE: ok but
DAVE: conspiracies aside
DAVE: did it ever really look like clear sailing to you
DAVE: thats not what i was seeing
DAVE: we are going to arrive and then soon after jack is going to show up
DAVE: and then we have to beat him right
DAVE: so there kind of is a time limit
DAVE: oh
DAVE: why not
DAVE: so
DAVE: no meteors came at all
DAVE: you mean by fucking up and having to scratch we also sort of saved earth in the process
DAVE: i see
DAVE: what about the players themselves
DAVE: they had to arrive on meteors too didnt they
DAVE: i guess the baby meteors were some exceptions too right
DAVE: ................
DAVE: what do you mean tweak the destination times
DAVE: where did they get sent to
DAVE: what
DAVE: uh
DAVE: so
DAVE: uh
DAVE: in this alt universe group of us and
DAVE: them
DAVE: which ones are the actual players
DAVE: fuck
DAVE: why did i know that was gonna be the answer
DAVE: i dunno if im ready to process the ramifications of this bullshit
DAVE: man
DAVE: at least im used to dealing with alt daves
DAVE: ive been fuck deep in alt daves before
DAVE: its a goddamn delight if you want to know the truth
DAVE: but i dont even know what to think about...
DAVE: lets not even talk about it ok
DAVE: can we slow down this meteor
DAVE: delay the meetup
DAVE: maybe fight jack for a little while
DAVE: but your mom was just a nice alcoholic spinster who liked wizards who you complained about for no reason
DAVE: she wasnt anything like an untouchable master of irony who could replace the meat in your sandwich before it even occurred to you what the fuck you were chewing
DAVE: let me ask you this did your mom ever wiggle a puppet in your face even ONCE
DAVE: fine well you can be on bro duty then
DAVE: ill be the ambassador to your mom
DAVE: and no that wasnt actually meant as the sick burn it sounded like
DAVE: yeah i know
DAVE: ill be the ambassador to my mom then
DAVE: that sounds pretty stupid when i say it that way
DAVE: whatever
DAVE: ill be the fuckin one man welcome wagon for the john and jade teen old people and also our mom thats the plan
DAVE: so when we finally see them we can get our shit into formation like trained acrobats
DAVE: like ill blow a whistle and we make a human pyramid got it
DAVE: that way we can totally avoid anything awkward
DAVE: what
DAVE: when
DAVE: wait that was her
DAVE: oh
DAVE: huh
DAVE: .....
DAVE: no
DAVE: god fucking dammit
DAVE: no what a load of shit
DAVE: stuff said between you and me before we knew we were related
DAVE: we both know that was a lot of horseplay bullfuckery between like smartass 10 year olds or whatever
DAVE: you cant seriously have taken any of that seriously
DAVE: ugh dont ever do that
DAVE: all these fuckin
DAVE: momtraps and sistertraps
DAVE: what a joke i hope skaia gets to have a good laugh over shit like this
DAVE: wait i forgot skaia doesnt laugh it just "sees" and "knows"
DAVE: its like a huge blue perv thats mad jazzed for kidcest
DAVE: dont you wink at her
DAVE: kanaya heres a protip that wink meant jack dick shes just being weird
DAVE: yeah im pretty much ollying outie too
DAVE: got some shit to attend to
DAVE: after you
DAVE: karkat is broken guys

DAVE: dunno but i was just leaving
DAVE: just stepping out to do a thing
DAVE: which is not your business

DAVE: hey dont be saying shit about the mayor
DAVE: the mayor rules hes like my best fucking friend
DAVE: hes a mayor you douche his thing says mayor
DAVE: no mayo is like grub sauce but without grubs
DAVE: like
DAVE: uh
DAVE: i dunno its white and it just sort of exists
DAVE: you dont ask about mayo thats not what you do with mayo
DAVE: hahaha you are pathetic
DAVE: this is why you all stormed in here out of breath
DAVE: what did you actually sprint all the way across the meteor to tell me this
DAVE: yeah and what i do with mine is mine
DAVE: watch me make them make me leave
DAVE: dude dont touch my cape

DAVE: man
DAVE: you are so overblowing this
DAVE: yeah you are
DAVE: you have some idea about us or what were getting up to
DAVE: so weve done a few things together to pass the time so what
DAVE: i dont even think you could call them dates or anything
DAVE: what the fuck would even qualify as a date on this gross dark meteor
DAVE: we have one of those???
DAVE: yeah i remember
DAVE: havent you only watched a bunch of shitty dane cook movies on infinite loop since we left
DAVE: dude
DAVE: you know youre only pretending to be a huge fan of his bullshit to piss me off

DAVE: you must be out of your fucking mind if you think i want to know where youre going with this
DAVE: im not reading that shit

DAVE: there is nothing even slightly applicable about any of that bullshit to our situation

DAVE: i can actually hear your sips through my headphones
DAVE: oh my god
DAVE: you are so fucking hammered
DAVE: how strong did you even make that stuff
DAVE: pretty strong
DAVE: rose you just bootlegged some fucking rubbing alcohol
DAVE: faculity isnt a word check mate
DAVE: this kinda strikes me as a sort of misappropriation of alchemy
DAVE: like fucking with the mystical technology of creation to whip up some moonshine just seems
DAVE: i dunno man
DAVE: tell me you at least alchemized a bathtub first to stir this shit in
DAVE: at least that would be hilarious
DAVE: and where the FUCK is my applejuice rose
DAVE: gotta say
DAVE: you really let me down on the aj front
DAVE: bullshit it was hard
DAVE: whats so hard about applejuice its like
DAVE: the most basic goddamn juice
DAVE: like the square one of juice
DAVE: uh
DAVE: well shit
DAVE: looks like i wandered into a really weird uncharted side of town tonight
DAVE: its called the drunk rose district
DAVE: and i am scared out of my fucking mind
DAVE: no!
DAVE: i told you i dont want any of your experimental fucking spacewizard booze
DAVE: id rather not go blind
DAVE: then terezi will have to teach me to lick shit to see
DAVE: is that what you want do you want me licking everything in sight
DAVE: like oh hey mayor SLURP oh fuck youre not the mayor youre my goddamn sister
DAVE: oh my god
DAVE: you laughed way too hard at that it wasnt anywhere close to that funny
DAVE: i think youve had enough
DAVE: good lord
DAVE: i still dont know why you were so bent on making this liquor
DAVE: i thought you werent really that down with the drinkin
DAVE: you never liked it when your mom drank what happened to that
DAVE: ok so why
DAVE: why tonight do you just decide to get completely wasted before you
DAVE: like
DAVE: are you nervous about your date with kanaya is that it
DAVE: uh
DAVE: yes
DAVE: rose
DAVE: you are wearing a friggin prom dress
DAVE: and nervously drinking your ass off
DAVE: while you are waiting for kanaya to arrive
DAVE: for a goddamn DATE
DAVE: this is infuriating
DAVE: why do you even bother with this stupid charade
DAVE: you could be at like a drive in movie making out with each other
DAVE: all exchanging class rings while giving birth to each others fucking children
DAVE: and you would still be all coy like IS IT A DATE OR ISNT IT HMMMM WHO CAN REALLY SAY FOR SURE???
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: that turned out to be one hell of a sip
DAVE: maybe you should just reschedule
DAVE: just sleep it off there are more hot dates where that came from
DAVE: im just not sure youre gonna make the best impression like this
DAVE: come on lets just find you a suitably soft pile of objects to sleep in before she
DAVE: aw shit
DAVE: shes here
DAVE: omfg i cant even deal
DAVE: (rose i think you started drinking way too early)
DAVE: (i think you just like)
DAVE: (completely fucking forgot to tell kanaya you were dressing up)
DAVE: (man youre gonna make her so uncomfortable all dolled up like that not to mention three sheets to the fucking wind)
DAVE: (this date is going to be so awkward)
DAVE: (yeah sure)
DAVE: (SMH)
DAVE: holy shit we got a room full of smooth operators here tonight
DAVE: yes kanaya it was going to be a romantically oriented date
DAVE: but as you can see rose is hooched to the fucking max
DAVE: so i think youre better off going out another time
DAVE: ugh
DAVE: you seriously still wanna go through with this
DAVE: a problem
DAVE: uh
DAVE: i dunno if youre cool with your date slurring words and making no damn sense about apples then
DAVE: i guess not???
DAVE: why are you both looking at me
DAVE: stop that
DAVE: no dont
DAVE: hey i am not your fucking life coach here
DAVE: if you want to go on a drunkdate what do i care
DAVE: man what do i even know about "human courtship" anyway
DAVE: not like i ever dated a fuckin human
DAVE: so i guess have at it
DAVE: awesome
DAVE: datenite with drunky it is
DAVE: go apeshit i guess
DAVE: uh so
DAVE: what should i do here
DAVE: you want me to pack up my raps and leave you alone or
DAVE: my pants
DAVE: what are you talking about
DAVE: theyre on my legs
DAVE: oh
DAVE: what
DAVE: for rose?
DAVE: uh yeah kind of
DAVE: man terezi doesnt need an intervention
DAVE: she just drinks a lot of soda
DAVE: its red fizzy shitwater dude who cares
DAVE: terezi has made her choices
DAVE: among them was to begin guzzling untold liters of that putrid circus cola
DAVE: think of it as like a rite of passage
DAVE: like something that just goes with the territory when someone you know almost imperceptibly begins turning into a juggalo
DAVE: wait fuck
DAVE: maybe she does need an intervention
DAVE: did you try kicking her
DAVE: im out of ideas
DAVE: man i dunno
DAVE: sounds like you wanna make this needlessly melodramatic
DAVE: speaker crab
DAVE: man dont put me on speaker crab
DAVE: god
DAVE: honestly she can do whatever she wants i put this all behind me a while ago
DAVE: why do you really want me in on this conversation is it just that you dont know what to say by yourself
DAVE: what
DAVE: hahaha thats what you think that does?
DAVE: no dude thats not what gift of gab does
DAVE: its utility isnt really comprehensible to lowly mortals sorry
DAVE: nah
DAVE: what do you actually want from her
DAVE: do you want her to stop drinking faygo and falling asleep in puddles of red fructose corn slobber
DAVE: or do you want her to somehow address the root of those habits and cut all that out for good
DAVE: yeah i can understand where youre coming from
DAVE: but in situations like this i think you need to remind yourself theres only so much you can do for somebody
DAVE: and maybe they arent going to want or need your help and you just have to figure out how to deal with that
DAVE: like at some point in your life one of your friends might start spending all her time with a guy you think is bad news
DAVE: and you have to decide if you need to intervene as a friend or just let it go because people can change or drift apart or whatever because thats just something that happens
DAVE: look all im saying is
DAVE: there comes a time in every young womans life when she has to come to terms with the decision to gradually morph into a juggalo while all her friends and loved ones watch in dismay
DAVE: terezi has strolled through the dark carnival and taken a great brooding whiff of that decisions festive asshole and the choice she has made is all too clear
DAVE: shes down with the clown
DAVE: its true man
DAVE: you can live in denial for only so long
DAVE: but as your bro i have to say it like it is
DAVE: she and gamzee man
DAVE: that is literally a thing
DAVE: they are in the hate square together
DAVE: total kismespades dude
DAVE: oh
DAVE: really?
DAVE: then what the fuck have i been tiptoeing around all this time god damn
DAVE: i thought this was supposed to be like this "big secret" that would "destroy you" if you found out
DAVE: then why is it a problem now
DAVE: what
DAVE: like i said i just put it behind me
DAVE: she started sneaking around in vents and stuff acting suspicious trying to hide the fact that she was seeing him
DAVE: like she was obviously ashamed of it and worried how id react
DAVE: but it was hella transparent that was going on so i just said
DAVE: thats fine yall can do your blackrom thing with the juggalo its your decision
DAVE: but i cant keep playing along
DAVE: i cant do the quadrant thing its just too weird for me
DAVE: im not a troll and im not all open minded about gettin multicultural
DAVE: i still dont understand the spades thing and it makes me really fuckin uncomfortable even trying to imagine how that works and i sure as fuck dont want to date anybody whos got a hateclown on the side
DAVE: so i said no hard feelings i still like you and all, do whatever makes you happy ill just be over here in the hyper gravity chamber training to beat lord english
DAVE: no
DAVE: but what about you
DAVE: havent you been talking to gamzee this whole time
DAVE: or is he just balls out lying to you about sneakin around the meteor with terezi
DAVE: i thought moirails were supposed to be open with each other about stuff like that
DAVE: oh shit
DAVE: sorry to hear about that
DAVE: amazing i spent three years on this rock and never said one thing to the guy
DAVE: i saw him once tho
DAVE: just a glimpse in a dark hallway
DAVE: it was kinda like seeing a blurry purple bigfoot with a huge boner
DAVE: why is he wearing it
DAVE: ahahaha the best thing we ever do together is slam this assholes dumb religion
DAVE: really its the most hilarious fucking horseshit ive ever heard
DAVE: i mean pretty much all religions are wrong but theres wrong and then theres WRONG
DAVE: as in ZERO CHANCE YOU ARE EVER PROVEN RIGHT ABOUT EVEN A SINGLE THING DUDE, EVER EVER EVER
DAVE: be one sad clown that day
DAVE: his bulge will probably deflate and make this high pitch noise plus corresponding flatulence
DAVE: what do you mean as friends
DAVE: uh
DAVE: yeah?
DAVE: no offense dog but thats a dumb and neurotic question
DAVE: you forgot the mayor
DAVE: youre pretty damn tight with the mayor arent you
DAVE: yeah the mayor rules
DAVE: but as usual you are overcomplicating this
DAVE: just like you overcomplicate everything
DAVE: friendship leadership romance
DAVE: shipping grids and dick battles
DAVE: this is real simple
DAVE: our meteor will somehow tokyo drift to a dead stop in the new session
DAVE: at which point we will keep being bros for life or something
DAVE: i will start being friends with john and jade again because they are my friends and never stopped being that
DAVE: john will also be your friend because hes cool and also a doofus who is easy to be friends with
DAVE: jade will be your friend too cause shes nice and likes being friends with people
DAVE: i can personally guarantee that she will be happy to see you
DAVE: and as for the new people i dont know about them but theyll probably be your friends too
DAVE: all i know is two of them are my parents and two of them are johns parents and aint no rule that says you cant be friends with your bros mom and pop
DAVE: especially when your bros mom and pop are a couple of sassy teens
DAVE: as for terezi i dont know i guess well see what happens
DAVE: and as for gamzee fuck that guy with a balloon poodle
DAVE: friendship lesson secured the end
DAVE: yeah dude you should probably ditch the chair
DAVE: or at least sit on it frontways
DAVE: or offer her another chair?
DAVE: i dunno its kind of a dumb affectation in this context
DAVE: to sit on the goddamn floor
DAVE: so you can be on the same vertical plane with your friend while you exhibit compassion for her grody clown problem
DAVE: karkat just threw a tantrum about a chair
DAVE: i just won karkat tantrum bingo
DAVE: where did you even get that chair
DAVE: did you steal it from the common area
DAVE: sounds like communism
DAVE: are you a communist or something
DAVE: actually that makes perfect sense what with your sickle and all
DAVE: wait john has a hammer oh shit its all adding up
DAVE: when we arrive are you going to team up with john and seize the means of production
DAVE: im just saying
DAVE: first chairs what next
DAVE: see i am all about private property and pocketing dough
DAVE: do you have any idea how rich i am
DAVE: i am a man of MEANS motherfucker
DAVE: just dont come after my boonies dude
DAVE: or should i say karkat marx
DAVE: i dont have much to say about this
DAVE: ive kinda got to recuse myself on the matter
DAVE: im all kinds of on record as being squicked out by the idea of hatelationships
DAVE: so i got no point of reference for gauging when one is fucked up the way thats normal for trolls or if its fucked up cause its actually fucked up and terrible
DAVE: this is like some ex alien boyfriend prime directive shit
DAVE: i cant intervene cause i dont know what im talking about
DAVE: but you do so i guess keep going
DAVE: you were saying some pretty good stuff before i started riding your jock about chairs
DAVE: thank you
DAVE: intermission?
DAVE: its not an intervention either
DAVE: my ghostly heads all beamin out of this crab for moral support yo
DAVE: i am in my homies corner even if he is a massive socialist
DAVE: terezi i think can probably figure this out
DAVE: she grew up alone and blind in a forest i think she will manage to bounce outta her juggalo phase
DAVE: but yeah terezi you should at least quit the fuckin soda
DAVE: what
DAVE: dont blame me
DAVE: i cant control the crab
DAVE: so
DAVE: has anyone figured out how were actually gonna stop this meteor
DAVE: or was three years not enough time to solve that problem
DAVE: i dont think thats possible dude
DAVE: in fact im not sure we were ever traveling at light speed
DAVE: i think maybe theres been some bogus science in circulation that we been chumped into gettin behind
DAVE: just saying
DAVE: man pull it together
DAVE: this thing has to have some escape pods or something
DAVE: or i guess maybe we could
DAVE: just sort of
DAVE: hop up
DAVE: and
DAVE: like...
DAVE: fly away?
DAVE: i swear to god
DAVE: this meteor needs one of those baby on board things on the back
DAVE: but like a grub instead of baby for max fidelity to the gag because TROLLZ
DAVE: i know you cant fly dude obviously i would just carry you or something
DAVE: rose shut the fuck up
DAVE: dude did you just bark
DAVE: why would i bark
DAVE: because youre having a mental breakdown
DAVE: nah
DAVE: wasnt me
DAVE: kanaya did you bark
DAVE: you fuckin with us maryam
DAVE: maybe the mayor barked
DAVE: mayor was that you
DAVE: haha i bet it was
