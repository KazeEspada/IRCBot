CT: D --> Hi
CT: D --> 100k
CT: D --> What are you e%pecting to accomplish with this
CT: D --> This is f001ishness upon one hundred thousand prior, equally unsolicited f001ishnesses
CT: D --> You'll stop now
CT: D --> I'm not
CT: D --> I'm fine
CT: D --> No I'm not
CT: D --> No
CT: D --> Yuck
CT: D --> Don't pol100t my incoming data stream with his name, or any sort of e%cremental language you pick up from his ilk
CT: D --> If you're 100king for a 100phole through which you may e%tract concessions from me, you'll have to 100k elsewhere
CT: D --> Nepeta, what did I say about that awful language
CT: D --> I won't stand for it, and you'll stop
CT: D --> Your fraternization with the base classes have 100sened your morals, can't you see this
CT: D --> Well, green b100d is ok, but it's not great
CT: D --> But that's why you're lucky to have me to 100k out for you
CT: D --> Because you don't know better, and you can't fight the role the mother had in store for you
CT: D --> My bow and arrow are highly dignified symbols
CT: D --> Archery is among the highest and most e%ceptional crafts, held in tremendous regard by the most a100f classes for centuries
CT: D --> No
CT: D --> No
CT: D --> No I don't
CT: D --> I think
CT: D --> We need to stop talking about archery
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> We will stop talking about archery
CT: D --> The topic is making me
CT: D --> Sweat
CT: D --> No, you're the one who e%ercises distasteful practices
CT: D --> You e%terminate beautiful, innocent creatures by the hundreds
CT: D --> I can't condone such wretched behavior
CT: D --> Beasts are meant to be 100ked upon with adoration
CT: D --> I guess that's basically acceptable in principle, but I still find it a bit unsavory
CT: D --> No they're not
CT: D --> You're wrong about me, Nepeta
CT: D --> I do like to play games
CT: D --> But they must be e%tremely important games with very high stakes
CT: D --> Not the kind played by trans100cent green wigglers who let 100se an e%cremental surge hard in their wiggler-bottom diaperstubs
CT: D --> As it happens I have arranged to play just such a game tonight
CT: D --> Aradia and I have a private engagement to be co-leaders of the b100 team
CT: D --> Absolutely not
CT: D --> I forbid this
CT: D --> You will take your position on the b100 team with me
CT: D --> That's nonsense, you're nowhere even remotely within my pro%imity that would be necessary to e%ecute such a maneuver
CT: D --> The thought of you fraternizing with and abetting those stink-b100ded h001igans strikes me as scandal beyond measure
CT: D --> I'm afraid you're too delicate to withstand that sort of corruption
CT: D --> It's forbidden
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> You won't
CT: D --> You won't
CT: D --> I am telling you not to
CT: D --> And you will be on my team
CT: D --> That's final
CT: D --> Quiet
CT: D --> No
CT: D --> I do not
CT: D --> And yet
CT: D --> You will do as I say
CT: D --> Yes we will
CT: D --> You will join me on my team shortly
CT: D --> Stand by for further instru%ion
CT: D --> You're angry, and I appreciate that
CT: D --> But it doesn't matter
CT: D --> Di%ussion over
CT: D --> Yes AC: :33 CT: D --> Yes AC: :33 CT: D --> Yes AC: :33 CT: D --> Yes AC: :33 CT: D --> Yes AC: :33 CT: D --> Yes AC: :33 CT: D --> Yes AC: :33 < no
CT: D --> Have I ever told you what a reprehensible disgrace you are
CT: D --> I'm not in a very good mood
CT: D --> There are a few things I'd like to get off my chest
CT: D --> What you do appear to know is e%actly how to ma%imize my livid contempt for you
CT: D --> With your revolting language and your sense of decorum
CT: D --> At such breathtaking odds with the richness and perfe%ion of your b100d
CT: D --> I just hate you so much
CT: D --> And the degrees to which you pollute your precious b100d
CT: D --> With your bottled fizzy sugar and soporific to%ins
CT: D --> Maddening
CT: D --> You will stop
CT: D --> No, you don't understand
CT: D --> It's not a predi%ion, it's an order
CT: D --> I command you to stop
CT: D --> What
CT: D --> Are you serious
CT: D --> No
CT: D --> This is una%eptable
CT: D --> Ok, let's start over
CT: D --> I apologize
CT: D --> I was completely out of of line, and I'm sorry
CT: D --> I have no right to talk to you like that, or tell you what you can't do
CT: D --> It's not my place
CT: D --> Your habits notwithstanding, I am lesser than you
CT: D --> An inferior
CT: D --> Don't you understand that you're better than me
CT: D --> Can you please act like it
CT: D --> That's not a command, it's just a polite request I guess
CT: D --> 100k, it isn't that difficult
CT: D --> Try to be cognizant of your desires and needs
CT: D --> And attempt to regard those around you as simple vehicles meant to bring about your gratification
CT: D --> What are you doing
CT: D --> Right now
CT: D --> It sounds as if you have begun playing with the red team
CT: D --> Is this true
CT: D --> Good
CT: D --> This is very good
CT: D --> It really pleases me to hear tales of physical subjugation
CT: D --> I presume these were lesser beings, toiling in the lower ranks of some hierarchy
CT: D --> Ok
CT: D --> It pleases me considerably less to hear things like that
CT: D --> But I've already stated I have no right to be disappointed by your conduct, so I will try to control myself
CT: D --> Hmm
CT: D --> Would it be too much to ask
CT: D --> For you to maybe
CT: D --> Boss me around a little
CT: D --> If it would help to couch it in those terms
CT: D --> Then yeah, I guess so
CT: D --> But not the especially juvenile kind
CT: D --> Let's keep it serious and professional
CT: D --> Just
CT: D --> Say anything
CT: D --> As long as it's authoritative
CT: D --> Hmm
CT: D --> Decent
CT: D --> I don't live near the ocean though, so it's hard to immerse myself in the scenario
CT: D --> I do so many bad things
CT: D --> Just awful things
CT: D --> I'm incredibly impudent and a superior needs to put me in my place
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> Yes, that's good
CT: D --> Like that
CT: D --> E%cellent
CT: D --> Now tell me this, highb100d
CT: D --> I've been roughhousing a little too hard lately
CT: D --> I've made a bit of a mess and anyone in a position of authority would surely be % about it
CT: D --> Cross
CT: D --> What do you make of it
CT: D --> This wretched misbehavior
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> So good
CT: D --> I am presently whipped into a state of contrition
CT: D --> One befitting of our class disparity
CT: D --> But I'm starting to perspire again so it's best that we stop
CT: D --> Thank you for indulging me
CT: D --> No
CT: D --> But I comprehend the sentiment
CT: D --> I have lots of thoughts, but they're difficult to communicate
CT: D --> If you'll listen
CT: D --> Honestly I'm confused by the social order
CT: D --> See, that's what I mean
CT: D --> How is it possible for one of your distin%ion to be so ignorant
CT: D --> And loathesome
CT: D --> Whereas
CT: D --> A member of the most abject, verminous b100dline of all
CT: D --> Can conduct herself with such grace and possess nothing but admirable mannerisms
CT: D --> I find these striking ju%tapositions perple%ing, and I confess strangely into%icating
CT: D --> I wonder if I have gone mad
CT: D --> To form such a pact with her
CT: D --> I shouldn't be talking about this
CT: D --> You're the enemy
CT: D --> What
CT: D --> How many
CT: D --> Good
CT: D --> Use your cunning and venom to make them envy our nobility
CT: D --> No
CT: D --> Humorous insincerity is for pedantic wigglers
CT: D --> That's because you're a little worse than me
CT: D --> It's finished
CT: D --> I'll deliver it shortly
CT: D --> I'm happy to help
CT: D --> But I don't understand why you're intent on gratifying that worthless peasant
CT: D --> Fine
CT: D --> Then let's proceed with the plan in a curt and professional manner
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> I guess it is pretty quaint
CT: D --> That's the plan
CT: D --> Yes, we're in absolute agreement
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> Stop
CT: D --> No, don't be absurd
CT: D --> Are you
CT: D --> Ok
CT: D --> There are no %%ings up my sleeve
CT: D --> Also, I don't have sleeves
CT: D --> I am as transparent as can be, and my word is my bond
CT: D --> You know
CT: D --> I can feel you trying to read my mind
CT: D --> Get out of my head, it's making me angry
CT: D --> Try to remember who built your arm for you
CT: D --> Aradia, here's the deal
CT: D --> Now that the game has begun, the plan will be modified slightly
CT: D --> We will not be co-leaders of the b100 team
CT: D --> I alone will be the leader
CT: D --> Is that understood
CT: D --> Good
CT: D --> Wait
CT: D --> You have no objection
CT: D --> Are you sure
CT: D --> Do you typically embrace such a passive attitude when your superiors give you orders
CT: D --> Hmm
CT: D --> I think I should get a towel
CT: D --> I'm perspiring heavily again
CT: D --> Never mind
CT: D --> I'm trying to stay professional about this
CT: D --> Forget it
CT: D --> It's just pleasant to consort with one of lesser breeding who clearly understands her place
CT: D --> Perfect
CT: D --> Then we are on the same page
CT: D --> I 100k forward to seeing how well you serve me, server player
CT: D --> What do you mean
CT: D --> I don't understand
CT: D --> Are you
CT: D --> Are you saying
CT: D --> That
CT: D --> You are in a position of control over me
CT: D --> Oh
CT: D --> Oh my God
CT: D --> This is
CT: D --> Impropriety of a caliber I cannot even
CT: D --> It's
CT: D --> You are as low on the hemosprectrum as possible
CT: D --> To consider that someone so low could be in a position of authority over me is
CT: D --> It's just so
CT: D --> Disgusting
CT: D --> No it's
CT: D --> FILTHY
CT: D --> I need some air
CT: D --> Or some cold milk
CT: D --> Or a towel, I need a towel
CT: D --> Where the fuck are all my fresh towels
CT: D --> I mean
CT: D --> Fiddlesticks, please pardon my language
CT: D --> It won't happen again
CT: D --> I'm fine
CT: D --> I'll be fine
CT: D --> I just need to breathe
CT: D --> And to break something possibly 
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> It helps me rela%
CT: D --> Do you
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> I just need a blasted towel
CT: D --> Where ever did that Aurthour get off to
CT: D --> Perhaps
CT: D --> Whoa what
CT: D --> Do you
CT: D --> Want to break something
CT: D --> I, uh
CT: D --> Ok
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> Yes that was wonderful
CT: D --> But could you please refrain from dipping into the vernacular of commoners
CT: D --> In fact, this is an order from your leader
CT: D --> Call things by their proper names
CT: D --> Nevertheless, do it
CT: D --> Now
CT: D --> Could you please
CT: D --> Uh
CT: D --> Do that again
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> Wait
CT: D --> I don't know
CT: D --> Maybe I don't want to order you to
CT: D --> Maybe I want
CT: D --> You to do whatever things that you want to do
CT: D --> You could cause quite a bother for me, with the power you wield
CT: D --> I can do nothing to stop you, peasant girl
CT: D --> It's so magnificently depraved
CT: D --> What was that
CT: D --> Are you role playing now
CT: D --> Stop, it's unbecoming
CT: D --> You're better than that
CT: D --> And by better, I mean worse
CT: D --> Much, much worse
CT: D --> Downright coarse and degenerate
CT: D --> Just reprehensibly sordid
CT: D --> Actually
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> You may role play and proceed to deepen this already irretrievable debauchery
CT: D --> In fact I command it
CT: D --> I command you to have free will and do as you please
CT: D --> And continue being bothersome and unpredictably destructive
CT: D --> I mean
CT: D --> If you want
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> Ribbit again
CT: D --> I will make haste through this mysterious realm and find your gate
CT: D --> It will pose no challenge for me at all
CT: D --> I will then give you your new body, and you may take your rightful place as my subordinate
CT: D --> Actually
CT: D --> Now I'm beginning to wonder
CT: D --> Whether I want you to be my subordinate
CT: D --> Hmm
CT: D --> I hope this doesn't sound too strange
CT: D --> Maybe I would like you to be the co-leader again
CT: D --> In fact
CT: D --> Oh my goodness, I can't believe I'm entertaining this thought
CT: D --> It feels just vile
CT: D --> Try not to roll your eyes at me
CT: D --> Would you mind terribly
CT: D --> Being the leader
CT: D --> But
CT: D --> Don't tell anyone
CT: D --> You will be the leader of me, and I will lead all else
CT: D --> You would in effect be the secret leader
CT: D --> Yes, that's the spirit
CT: D --> You take to authority well for one of your b100d
CT: D --> Not yet
CT: D --> But soon your heart will beat anew, and through it, fresh b100d and fresh passion
CT: D --> On my way
EQUIUS: D --> Yes
EQUIUS: D --> It is perfect in every way
EQUIUS: D --> Do you
EQUIUS: D --> Have a clean towel anywhere
EQUIUS: D --> I think it suits you
EQUIUS: D --> Much more so than the form of a levitating ghostly amphibian
EQUIUS: D --> How does it feel
EQUIUS: D --> Ok
EQUIUS: D --> But I mean
EQUIUS: D --> Do you feel anything else
EQUIUS: D --> Any sort of
EQUIUS: D --> Stirring sensations
EQUIUS: D --> Yes
EQUIUS: D --> Such as
EQUIUS: D --> Sensations which may be stirred by flowing b100d and a beating heart
EQUIUS: D --> Can you detect anything within you might describe as
EQUIUS: D --> Smoldering passion
EQUIUS: D --> I mean
EQUIUS: D --> Just out of curiosity
EQUIUS: D --> What's what
EQUIUS: D --> Hrrrk
EQUIUS: D --> I
EQUIUS: D --> Yes
EQUIUS: D --> Uh
EQUIUS: D --> It's a chip in your heart
EQUIUS: D --> Is that not ok
EQUIUS: D --> Urrk
EQUIUS: D --> I guess I can
EQUIUS: D --> Uninstall it if you would just
EQUIUS: D --> Sorry
EQUIUS: D --> I'll
EQUIUS: D --> Hrrrrrrk
Equius: Aradia ?
EQUIUS: D --> I only supplied the technological means, though my lobbying for a hooven quadrupedal lower torso went tragically disregarded
EQUIUS: D --> Yes, I can follow that order, sir
EQUIUS: D --> Are there any other orders you would like to issue to me in a manner that is similarly forceful
EQUIUS: D --> Yes, and you will continue to order me to do so. I command it
EQUIUS: D --> ...
EQUIUS: D --> I need a towel
EQUIUS: D --> Aurthour is dead, and so is his ghost
EQUIUS: D --> Remember
EQUIUS: D --> Is this where embrace jocularly, as if we are bros
EQUIUS: D --> I will be as gentle as possible
EQUIUS: D --> I...
EQUIUS: D --> You're absolutely right, it's disgraceful
EQUIUS: D --> I think it is possibly time to admit I have some sort of problem
EQUIUS: D --> I would very much like to honor my position on the hemospectrum and mistreat those beneath me, and yet...
EQUIUS: D --> It's mystifying
EQUIUS: D --> In spite of my warnings, he seems absolutely committed to being attracted to cases of stairs like a goshdarned magnetron
EQUIUS: D --> Now that I think about it, I should probably deactivate his pelvic magnetron
CT: D --> I'm attempting to determine what it is that ranks humans in their class stru%ure
CT: D --> I'd assumed the color of your b100d would serve as the basis for placement in the hierarchy, as would be e%pected and natural, but I was mistaken
CT: D --> I was similarly in error believing the color of what you type corresponds with the color of your b100d
CT: D --> Well, obviously
CT: D --> I understand that now, I'm not a f001
CT: D --> I see
CT: D --> So, in other words, a sort of b100d letting ritual
CT: D --> To assess whose pulse is steadiest and thus whose flow is the most STRONG
CT: D --> Really
CT: D --> So your social e%elons are dictated by the noble artform of the ancient slam poets
CT: D --> Or the Earth equivalent
CT: D --> I believe
CT: D --> That this is probably nonsense
CT: D --> I've already been hornswoggled repeatedly by your comrades, who I quite reasonably mistook for your superiors in b100dline
CT: D --> Your race makes a habit of deception, and I will not tolerate it
CT: D --> You will stop
CT: D --> I command that all verbal misdire%ion and hoofbeastplay will cease during my communications, is that understood
CT: D --> Did I say something entertaining
CT: D --> I try to stay engaged with many aristocratic practices
CT: D --> But I'm not much of a poet
CT: D --> My poems are private
CT: D --> If you're prepared to be particularly forceful about it
CT: D --> I may be suitably disgusted to comply
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> Those are the sorts of assertive statements which could get me
CT: D --> Flowing
CT: D --> Just a thought. Let's mock a topic with less awfulness
CT: D --> If you'd use the e%cuse to be less culturally myopic, what are your views on abuse to the walking apocrypha
CT: D --> Would you choose if duly cued to put your bruising clop to a flock of naughty roboti%
CT: D --> Perhaps it's that it's martial tacti% that matter for status. Unless you redact this
CT: D --> I'd hazard in practice that it's a glass of what's lactic that would impact this
CT: D --> Pragmatic to presume? A human metric for grandness stands on fondness in honest
CT: D --> For wanton aplomb with strapping song smithing, ripping sonnets of STRONGNESS
CT: D --> But perhaps
CT: D --> To divine class divides in unclassified swine is butchering time
CT: D --> Your fauna I find requires too little strength to savage in rhyme
CT: D --> I fear inferiors have monopolized my highest priorities
CT: D --> Let's eschew crude inferiors, pursue nude superiorities
CT: D --> Review z001ogical peculiarities, great stalking enormities
CT: D --> Fle%ing in unison, baying at moons within fraternal sororities
CT: D --> Great musclebeasts tussle, bu%om in heft
CT: D --> With thunderous muscle, buttock to spec
CT: D --> Connect blows to discover, how invincible pecs are
CT: D --> Venture low to uncover, his inimitable nectar
CT: D --> Should song serve to placate one
CT: D --> And fortune holds he lactate some
CT: D --> STRONG hands tugging teat make great ambrosia collectors
CT: D --> What do you mean
CT: D --> Are you ordering me to conceal my poems again
CT: D --> It 100ks to be a legendary weapon
CT: D --> Giving up on the treasure so easily
CT: D --> It strikes me as an artifact rooted in universal lore of nobility
CT: D --> As valuable an asset as strength is
CT: D --> And as much as anyone with his wits is fond of being STRONG
CT: D --> Such weapons require finesse to operate
CT: D --> And surely in this case, to retrieve without damaging
CT: D --> Hence your no doubt frustrating restraint
CT: D --> E%cessive force will shatter such weapons
CT: D --> We both know this from e%perience
CT: D --> The adult human who trained you
CT: D --> And taught you the ways of being STRONG
CT: D --> Remember
CT: D --> Yes, and now, being learned in the ways of STRONGNESS
CT: D --> You like myself are unfortunately limited in the weaponry you may wield
CT: D --> Ironically the training which has ennobled you beyond others has made instruments of high b100d brittle in your hands
CT: D --> Hence the state of your favored weapon, hobbling your specibus
CT: D --> I know what this is like
CT: D --> Oh
CT: D --> No
CT: D --> Bows
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> Sometimes
CT: D --> What are you doing
CT: D --> Careful
CT: D --> About succumbing to these sorts of destructive
CT: D --> Urges
CT: D --> Addi%ion is a powerful thing
CT: D --> I think
CT: D --> I need
CT: D --> Something to dry myself off with
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> I am still e%ceptionally STRONG
CT: D --> Strength continues to be my STRONGEST attribute
CT: D --> With what
CT: D --> You mean
CT: D --> The highb100d
CT: D --> Oh dear
CT: D --> Are you saying the highb100d has finally embraced his position atop the hierarchy
CT: D --> Yes e%actly
CT: D --> I certainly appreciate the debauchery inherent in receiving an order of such gravity from a rogue-b100ded foulmouth
CT: D --> But
CT: D --> I'm not entirely positive I can raise a hand to the highb100d
CT: D --> It wouldn't be my place
CT: D --> Uh
CT: D --> No, I have a sufficient supply of drying utilities
CT: D --> The b100d
CT: D --> It is just so
CT: D --> E%quisitely purple
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> But 100k
CT: D --> The situation is very delicate I believe
CT: D --> The highb100d would benefit from a proper enculturation into the aristocracy
CT: D --> I'll take measures to ensure our comrades aren't injured
CT: D --> Well
CT: D --> If it comes to close quarters skirmish, I will try to be prepared
CT: D --> Yes
CT: D --> That's different
CT: D --> He is a sea dweller
CT: D --> Our feud is codified in tradition
CT: D --> Neigh, we are obligated to be at odds
CT: D --> It's dignified
CT: D --> He is
CT: D --> How many of us are rampaging murderously, e%actly
CT: D --> Do I really have to
CT: D --> I'd prefer not to interact with him
CT: D --> It's primarily that his advances make me uncomfortable
CT: D --> We are
CT: D --> Oh shoot
CT: D --> E%cuse my vulgarity
CT: D --> I will 100k into it
EQUIUS: D --> I regard the furrocious moirail stoically
EQUIUS: D --> I mean
EQUIUS: D --> I greet Ms. Leijon without issuing a statement of a%ion in the first person
EQUIUS: D --> Mr Zahhak, I mean I, will probably be feeling b100 about that for some time, yes
EQUIUS: D --> But he is, darn it, I am, e%ceptionally STRONG and will cope with it admirably
EQUIUS: D --> Even though
EQUIUS: D --> She didn't even say goodbye for some reason
EQUIUS: D --> How long have we already spent in the roboti% pile
EQUIUS: D --> I believe it was at least an hour
EQUIUS: D --> We e%amined my emotional state until we were both bl00 in the face
EQUIUS: D --> What
EQUIUS: D --> I know
EQUIUS: D --> Nepeta, I think it would behoove us to address the e%treme danger in a serious manner
EQUIUS: D --> That's because you still refuse to 100k upon our b100dlines as the deciding behoovioral factors they are
EQUIUS: D --> Behavioral
EQUIUS: D --> Sorry, my heart is galloping and I canter nunciate properly
EQUIUS: D --> The horst case scenario is upon us
EQUIUS: D --> His is the richest and most noble b100d possible among the high land dwellers
EQUIUS: D --> As such, he is prone to being more violent and unpredictable than any of us
EQUIUS: D --> Not everyone has been as lucky as I in the domain of moirallegiance
EQUIUS: D --> I udder to think what I might be without you, Nepeta
EQUIUS: D --> Shudder
EQUIUS: D --> Yes, which is among the reasons why I must make your prote%ion a high priority
EQUIUS: D --> The highb100d has joined a stable of those who are becoming increasingly volatile and murderous as we remain stranded in this laboratory
EQUIUS: D --> I command you to steer clear of them, do you understand NEPETA: :33 < h33, did you mean st33r in the livestock sense?
EQUIUS: D --> Yes
EQUIUS: D --> E%cellent
EQUIUS: D --> I would still prefur you hide, I mean prefer
EQUIUS: D --> Behind that gait
EQUIUS: D --> I mean that door over there, you goshdarned sillyface
EQUIUS: D --> I will now seek the highb100d, Nepeta
EQUIUS: D --> I command you to go hide, as we di%ussed
EQUIUS: D --> I will e%act caution, even when safety 100% to be 100% assured
EQUIUS: D --> Even so
EQUIUS: D --> I would still like to take the opportunity to say
EQUIUS: D --> Goodbye
EQUIUS: D --> Yes, you will
EQUIUS: D --> For pete's goodfornothing di%ie whistling SA%ES, Nepeta
EQUIUS: D --> I am through talking about feelings, now go hide like I commanded
EQUIUS: D --> I do not hoove claws
EQUIUS: D --> I mean have claws
EQUIUS: D --> *Mr. Zahhak rolls his eyes, which remain concealed and a100f as ever*
EQUIUS: D --> I suppose
EQUIUS: D --> You did
EQUIUS: D --> Uh huh
EQUIUS: D --> That's a nice thought, and thank you for sharing it
EQUIUS: D --> But it was only a dream, and will surely have no consequence in reality
EQUIUS: D --> Okay, just for a while though
EQUIUS: D --> :33 < *I, a mu%ular man who is clearly a feline-obsessed female at the moment, do something suitably cat-like in accordance with the nature of this juvenile theatrical amusement*
EQUIUS: D --> That's not how I talk
EQUIUS: D --> Oh good grief
EQUIUS: D --> Fine
EQUIUS: D --> :33 < *I, again as a lithe clawed female wearing a preposterous hood, I mean prepawsterous, strike a supine posture on the floor, darn it, pawsture*
EQUIUS: D --> :33 < *The e%posed belly commands to be scratched*
EQUIUS: D --> :33 < *It commands it, do as it says*
EQUIUS: D --> :33 < *The scruffy haired, saucer eyed smart alec takes issue with the tone of the girl currently posing as said hulking brute*
EQUIUS: D --> :33 < *She/he wonders if he/she appurreciates that the pawerful nobleman currently meow%querading as her/him would be more than happy to accommeowdate said cuddly stuff, outrageous STRONGNESS purrmitting*
EQUIUS: D --> Language
EQUIUS: D --> What am I doing wrong
EQUIUS: D --> How would you recommend I approach the absurdist charade, then
EQUIUS: D --> I was having fun
EQUIUS: D --> The line about the belly scratching was e%ceptionally playful, and I am to be commended
EQUIUS: D --> You will commend me, I command it
EQUIUS: D --> I think I'm out of material though
EQUIUS: D --> I don't actually know that much about cats
EQUIUS: D --> Very well, here is your hood
EQUIUS: D --> I
EQUIUS: D --> I can't tell you how touching I find this gesture, Nepeta
EQUIUS: D --> Thank you, from the very bottom of my ludi%ly powerful cardiova%ular system
EQUIUS: D --> Ah, it's you, Pyrope
EQUIUS: D --> Have you seen the highb100d about
EQUIUS: D --> Pardon, "smelled"
EQUIUS: D --> Peasantb100d
EQUIUS: D --> Is that a joke
EQUIUS: D --> The profanity is sickening
EQUIUS: D --> You'll stop
EQUIUS: D --> You are not Pyrope
EQUIUS: D --> You are the highb100d, I should have known
EQUIUS: D --> Remove your counterfeit eyewear at once
EQUIUS: D --> Uh
