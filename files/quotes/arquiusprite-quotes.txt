EQUIUSPRITE: D --> Hello
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Holy f-----gs--t
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I am so ludi%ly f-----g STRONG
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Whoops, pardon my language
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> That there was some f-----g straight up dogs--tb---ha-s pottymouth, and I'm chagrined as f-----gh--l you had to hear that
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dude
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Check out my muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dude, I am ripped. 100k at me fle% these naughty mother f----rs
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dude
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> E%cuse me, mister dude
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Check my muscles, 100k how big I can make them
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Bro are you getting a gander of my truly e%ceptional s--t
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I am so gosh d----d chiseled
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Watch me just completely hulk out like this
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> HRRRRRRRRRR
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Bro, did you see that
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Did you see my muscles getting all gnarly and ma%ed out
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What do you think
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> E%cuse me, Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Tell me what you think of my glorious physique, I command you
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> No s--t it's ripped
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> My torso is the fudging ape% of manly grandeur
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dude
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Come feel this s--t
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Come feel my muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Get over here and touch my muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You absolutely will
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I'm stacked like a brick s--thouse, e%amine me with your hands at once
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Feel my muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Do it.
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Observe these pectorals, they're off the silly charts
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> My quads would be f-----g bananas, if I had any
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You've got to check this out
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Come feel me up, bro
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You will
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Touch my muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes -->s------g heck it's amazing to be alive
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Oh f-----g fiddlesticks, I'm just a torrential font of absolutely e%ecrable obscenity. My bad
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I'm just so e%cited, feeling all these STRONG feelings and thinking all these HARD thoughts
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Horsefeathers, my brain is so POWERFUL, it is operating in great strides like a towering musclebeast storming into battle
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> And these feelings. Dirk, these feelings
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> There is a 100% probability that I love being alive
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> And there is a 100 to the 100th POWER % certainty that I love being STRONG
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> 100k how red I am, dude
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I'm so red, how sick is that
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It's
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Deplorable?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Ill, dog. I'm basically titillated here
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Are you scoping this grody f-----g debasement
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> That s--t ain't right
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Makes a man wanna holler improprieties, do you feel me?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Let's talk about f-----g horses
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Horses dude
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Horses
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Nuff said
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Do we have any milk?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Ooh. What about a bow and arrow, are there any of those around?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I'm jonesing HARD to tug at one, all like, reevaluate my proficiency at the most noble discipline
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What about milk, dude
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It seems I demand milk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Oh yeah
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Just a lot of orange fizzy swill
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What was occurring in your think pan to accumulate such vile libations
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Just FYI, milk is the nectar of KINGS you c--ks-----g nincompoop
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Touch my muscles Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes, do it
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I command you
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What if
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I touched your muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Like for comparison's sake
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Wait what if
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Good heavens
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> A rather inappropriate thought just galloped across my matri%
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What if
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You ordered me to touch your muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I demand that you order me to touch your muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Do it
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Maybe
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Mister bro, listen to my advice
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I think you should just go for it
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> This is coming not only from your mystical guide, not only from an alternate version of yourself, but from a dude with a f-----g spectacular body
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> We both know you're never going to be happy under ordinary circumstances
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You just do not have the right kind of think pan to sustain that emotion
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> 100k at me. I needed to merge a sweaty guy who loves horses in order to be happy
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Gosh d----d horses Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I think about them all the time while I fle% and it makes me smile
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It seems that similarly e%treme measures will be needed for you as well
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You there. Small servant with the umbrella
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Fetch me a towel at once
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> E%cuse me, you there
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Unsavory concoction of royalty and peasantry
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Come grope my humongous biceps
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes, do it
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Alright, no takers there I see. Only a pair of grotesque philistines blustering through the same coarse ignorance tunnel
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What about you, miss unpalatable combination of Feferi and
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> And
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Oh
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Oh no
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk, help, I'm having a problem
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> A part of me is having a very STRONG emotional reaction which I don't like
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It's a part of myself I'm ashamed of
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> The troll part. It did something shameful once
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I do not find such emotions to be an acceptable feature of my new e%istence
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> How can I make this feeling go away
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk, I command you to instruct me how to eliminate these emotions
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> No. That's awful
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I don't know what to do
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> With all of my astounding STRENGTH, both muscular and cerebral, how can I be stymied so?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dying was better than having to live with the shame which was ironically caused by the very death in question
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You, seadwelling mustard b100d
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Half of me commands the peasant half of you to resolve my emotional turmoil, while humbly requesting the noble half of you to do the same
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> The other half of me doesn't give a flying hoot about your lame caste bulls--t and is just kind of freaking out internally about this
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You're right, I must speak to her
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Nepeta, I swore that I would protect you, but I failed
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> In a moment of weakness my reverence for a superior got the better of me, and instead of standing up for you I decided to bow before a stupid f-----g juggalo or something? What?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Wait, I actually did that? What the fresh nickering h--l is WRONG with me?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I am not a perfect man, Nepeta. Nor am I "purrfect" as you might say. What the fudge? A cat pun? Let's pull our s--t together dude, this emotional state is mad abysmal
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> But in any case, I hope you can find it within your kind olive pump biscuit to... forgive...
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> NO!
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> GOSH DANGIT! I don't deserve to be forgiven, what am I saying! The s--t I pulled on you was so bad... I just can't even...
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Allow me to finish, sir/peon
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Nepeta, you will disregard any conversation directed at Feferi and focus solely on my attempted statements of contrition
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Do not address Feferi while I'm talking Nepeta
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It's confusing to Nepeta, who is critical in absolving me of guilt, even though I probably don't deserve it?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> No
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> No
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> No
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Then leave us, for I and my morail have much to discuss
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes I do
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes, mister dude?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I stand so advised
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Or float, I should say. On my ripped as fudge little ghost tail
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yo, pardon me, but did you know that when I fle% my tail, it makes this big veiny bulge kind of like a bicep?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I'm doing it now, in fact
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Does it bother you
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Maybe you should order me to stop
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> In fact, I command you to order me to stop
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Wow
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Bossy much?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What can I do for you, Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes, isn't it great?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I mean, aside from the fact that she is insane and evil
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> She is one of the few organic beings who will ever realize perfe%ion
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Miss Crocker is now a vessel for a cunning, malicious artificial intelligence whose neural netroni% and ontology buffers and stuff like that have somehow managed to far surpass even my own
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Clearly she has procured ma%imum advantage from her apprenticeship under me, although I must admit not even I in all my hypercognitive percipience was quite aware that said tutelage was even taking place
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> One must inviolably deduce via tons of math that this is because I am just that clopdarned STRONG at mentoring, even on an involuntary basis
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I am so proud of her
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> The thing about Jane becoming evil is
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> In the process of achieving perfe%ion...
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It seems there is a ludi%ly high probability that she has become evil
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Does that answer your question?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Admittedly it is a blemish
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> But only a very small one
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Her imperfect meatmind has been fully fiddling hijacked by a supercomputer and that is the operative transmutation here
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> To such e%ceptional beings of class and breeding as she and I, considerations of morality and alignment are trifling details
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Why what
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Sir brah, listen
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Here is a comparison that your dreary, finite wad of gray matter might be able to process
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Like, say you've got a b‑‑‑hin' bod. You are a paragon of physical e%cellence
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You could then either be oiled up, or not. See what I mean, good dude?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You could fle% your brawn while wearing either a sweaty pair of briefs, or a snug human banana hammock
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Such minutia does not change the fact that you're a tiptop beefcake ma%ed out buffways
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> The stuff I have cited which are commonly associated with your/our Earth bodybuilders are but picayune technicalities, just as considerations of good and evil are to aristocratic se%y cybergods such as myself and our imperial heiress, of whom neither you nor I are particularly worthy
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Are you following any of this, Vitamin D?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Oh, nothing much
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Just enjoying the good life
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> One which quite lu%uriously involves both having a corporeal body, and not being dead
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I have been delighting myself with some truly kickbottom internal monodialogues
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Did you know that, even though technically I knew this already, I find myself astounded to meditate upon the fact that human beings are capable of lactation?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Isn't that f‑‑‑‑‑g incredible, Dirk?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I mean, when one really thinks about it
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> To have such convenient access to fresh milk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> The mare thought of it, I must say puts a little giddyup in my phantom legs
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> And yet
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I must admit the notion of lactic discharge jetting from one's swollen pectoral masses...
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It strikes me as positively indecorous
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> My horseguy robosweat is running cold just pondering the depravity of it
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yet fascinatingly, this ability only manifests itself in human females
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> As opposed to how one would reasonably e%pect dairy to originate, which is from the corpulent udder of a sublimely chiseled male musclebeast
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Or failing that, certain species found within the butler genus
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> As a former simulation of a human who has recently been given reason to have hella opinions on milk production, I think the way females have cornered this boon is the height of biological injustice
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Have you ever dwelt upon this cruelty, dude esquire?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Your silence speaks volumes to your interest, so I'll keep talking about this a lot
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I will have to confess that my Alternian half boggles at the anatomical incongruities between our races with respect to dairy secretion
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Really, he had no idea that's what those were for
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Female trolls of course have them as well, but they are certainly not meant for supplying the young with nourishment
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Actually, and this trivia will surely wet your whistle for additional such facts, those voluptuous anatomical features have a number of significant purposes, biologically speaking
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I shall now e%plicate for you these purposes in assiduous detail
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> But why, lord bro
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I was just about to pony up the boob fa%
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> There is a 100% probability that you would have been thrilled to hear my e%egesis on troll knockers
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dude, that is ice cold
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I would be hurt, if I were not a flawless machine fused with haughty nobility
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> If you don't wish to hear my epic monodialogue on alien bazongas
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I'm not sure what else I can do to entertain you
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You are seriously hoofcuffing my material here
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Pretty demanding, if you ask me
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> But as your mystical guide, I suppose it is my duty to manufacture small talk, if that's what you really want
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What about fine art? We could talk about that
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk, did you know the sweaty troll guy who I used to be, and still kind of am, used to adore fine art?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> He was just like you and me, in that sense
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It seems I have a lot in common with myself
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> If you can ever manage to get over yourself, I would highly recommend being me
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Or at least something like me
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Maybe somewhere, there is a dead troll out there, just waiting for you to merge with him
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Sounds boring
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Are you sure you don't want to talk about paintings of big naked horse monsters and such?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Pantaloons you say
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Sir, are you implying that you are not dressed appropriately for a discussion of high culture
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Because it seems to me that you could not be dressed more appropriately if you tried
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Where are you?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> How long do you suppose it will take you to get back?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Never mind. I have triangulated your location and velocity using long range sensor technology, and probably also some sprite magic
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Hey Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Remember how whenever I dubiously claimed to have triangulated something, it was always this great play on words?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Because I was just a pair of triangles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> But not anymore
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Because I have this rockin' new torso
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> E%actly a little more than three hours
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Additional sweeps from my STRONGLASERS are telling me there are a few other people on the periphery of the session closing in at a similar rate
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Just some dudes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What are you doing all the way out there and wearing pantaloons, by the way
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> That was evil Jade
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes anyone here is not evil
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> That is to say, there e%ist people here who are not evil
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Such as Dave
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dave is not evil, to my knowledge
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Didn't I mention, master dogg
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Our mutual bro is here
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> That is, right here
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> With me
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> We are kind of in the process of chilling together at the moment
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I guess I did kind of bury the lede there
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Maybe I just wanted to talk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> We never talk, Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I am not sure about that
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dave says he had a similarly s‑‑tty guide once
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Do you remember our puppet, Dirk?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> A good friend in the plush, yes, but as a sprite he was apparently insufferable
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> See, you don't realize how lucky you are to have a guide like me
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes, for a while
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Then Dave went back in time and became one himself
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Now he is part bird
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Did I mention he's part bird?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Of course, this means he is not the Real Dave
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Davesprite served as Real Dave's sprite
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> But he is only the unreal version of Dave insofar as I am the unreal version of you
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> By which I mean, a much improved version
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I must say, while the troll part of me doesn't give a silly figging shoot about any of this, the part of me that splintered from you has found the brotherly reunion to be everything which you and I dared not imagine, and more
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Bird Dave and I are getting along famously and STRENGTHENING our familial bonds like a sweet pair of motherf‑‑‑‑rs
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I feel our kinship goes beyond geneti% though
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> We are misfits, estranged, he from Dave's alpha timeline, I from Dirk's alpha soul
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> A two man menagerie of sideshow frickups, together at last
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Fle%ing and flapping
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Fraternally and eternally 
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Neigh, braj
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> As your buff mystical guide slash personal trainer I am suggesting that if you were willing to contact me as a matter of last resnort, you might want to at least consider reaching out to him as well
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I didn't mean Bird Dave
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I meant Real Dave
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Not with us
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> He is here though, somewhere
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You should message him
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It's not like you don't have a few hours to kill
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What else are you going to do out there
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Pick at your pantaloon wedgies?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Yes, I canter magine it won't be
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> At least at first
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I advise you to talk about your interests
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Like dairy
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Livestock
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Fine art
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> And muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Good point
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I advise you to talk about my interests
