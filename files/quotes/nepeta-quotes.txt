AC: :33 < *ac saunters from her dark cave a little bit sl33py from the recent kill*
AC: :33 < *ac uses one of her mouths to lick the fresh blood off her paws*
AC: :33 < *and the other one to blow you a kiss!*
AC: :33 < *yes! ac finds that to be a most admirable use of a kiss!*
AC: :33 < *she thinks that goblin wishes n33d to come true too just like any other kind of purrsons wishes*
AC: :33 < *ac begs your pardon while she rips apart this tasty beast to prepare a meal for her cubs*
AC: :33 < uh oh!
AC: :33 < dont you dare!
AC: :33 < i mean
AC: :33 < *ac shouts dont you dare!*
AC: :33 < *indignantly*
AC: :33 < *ac says noooooooo and looks a bit crestfallen*
AC: :33 < *ac gets a clever idea to slake the majestic dragons mighty hunger*
AC: :33 < *she prepares the lions share of the slain armored cholerbear for gc*
AC: :33 < *ac pawses a moment and nods knowingly with a couple of smug grins on her face*
AC: :33 < *she confirms it is ind33d the bulliest of bears!*
AC: :33 < *but as it happens the really cute cub lands in a bush safe and sound, whew!*
AC: :33 < *ac crinkles up her nose and prepares for a really unprecedented marathon of baffling feline obstinacy*
AC: :33 < *her dragonyyydy suitor will make neither rhyme nor reason of her purrplexing behavior for even an instant!*

AC: :33 < i know!
AC: :33 < but still im kind of scared of him and i think purrhaps its best to just run it by him first so there isnt a kerfuffle about it or anything
AC: :33 < i knooow
AC: :33 < but i dont think itll be a big deal
AC: :33 < ill just mention it casually and itll be fine im sure and then we can play in just a little bit!
AC: :33 < k!

AC: :33 < *she wiggles her rear end a bit and then chases something she s33s bounce into one of karkats shoes*
AC: :33 < i am???

NEPETA: :33 < i dont think we have even scratched the surface of our f33lings yet, and our f33lings in this case are a very tall and inviting carpeted post to sink our claws into!
NEPETA: :33 < i KNOW, i was speaking metafurrikitty :33
NEPETA: :33 < besides, i know for a FACT that you are still f33ling b100 (h33h33) from losing aradia

NEPETA: :33 < she was so happy, just like she used to be, and she said she would s33 you soon!
NEPETA: :33 < equius?
NEPETA: :33  Maybe
NEPETA: :33 < then we must take this to the pile, scratching-posthaste!!! ;33
NEPETA: :33  *STRONG EQUIUS NO LIKE HISS-POOR ATTEMPT AT ROLEPLAY, ALSO DISAPPROVES OF MISSED OPPURRTUNITY TO SPELL AMUSEMENT AS AMEWSMENT*

NEPETA: :33 < sorry :((
NEPETA: :33 < well you dont always have to announce who you are purrtending to be in every line! and you dont always have to point out that its just purrtend!
NEPETA: :33 < in fact, that is sort of an RPing no no
NEPETA: :33 < oh i dunno, just by having fun and having a sense of humor about it and such! and not sneaking in sneaky sneakret little barbs of disdain for the exercise, i am not dumb you know, i catch those like scared little scurrying rodents!
NEPETA: :33 < yes yes, ok youre right. that was really great!
NEPETA: :33 < do more of that. ok ready? go!

NEPETA: :33 < why dont
NEPETA: :33 < you hang on to that
NEPETA: :33 < forever!
NEPETA: :33 < it is my purrsent to you
NEPETA: :33 < dont mention it! <33
AC: :33 < jaspers i guess i should say furwell to you now :((
AC: :33 < beclaws this is the end of your timeline and i dont know what catpuns to you after this
AC: :33 < i mean happens to you after this, heheh, that one was kind of obtuse, sorry
AC: :33 < hmmmmmm thats a hard question
AC: :33 < ok imagine a long tempting strand of yarn
AC: :33 < now imagine instead of being made of wiggly enticing stuff, its made of what lets you exist
AC: :33 < and you are right at the twitching tip of it, dont you s33? look at the sky!
AC: :33 < thats fine, you dont have to try too hard
AC: :33 < all you have to know is its the scratch and im not a hundred purrcent sure what happens next fur you
AC: :33 < h33h33h33 :DD
AC: :33 < well you know roses friend john?
AC: :33 < imagine that he is using this great big circle like a really fun scratching post, and it makes all this light come out that changes everything
AC: :33 < just after he starts doing that the sky goes funny everywhere and then i cant s33 you anymore
AC: :33 < thats what it is
AC: :33 < im a bit nervous for you, especially since you remind me so much of someone i already lost
AC: :33 < but maybe youll be ok? i dont know
AC: :33 < you are a brave kitty, just like pounce was <33
AC: :33 < yes! she was amazing, i bet you and she would have gotten along famousely
AC: :33 < yes she smelled really good, and also, she was SUPER beautyifful.
AC: :33 < did you ever have someone nice back on earth who you loved?
AC: :33 < h33h33, of course you did. i mean a nice cat who was your matesprit?
AC: :33 < thats too bad
AC: :33 < but i bet lots of girl cats would have loved to be with you, if only there had b33n some around to hear your lovely meows :33
AC: :33 < me?
AC: :33 < well
AC: :33 < i have never told anybody this not even my moirail
AC: :33 < heh, actually hes the LAST guy i might tell, he so wouldnt appurrve X33
AC: :33 < but yes i have liked somebody for quite some time, but alas he doesnt know it
AC: :33 < hmmmmm
AC: :33 < ohhh no no no, im too shy even for that!
AC: :33 < and he is so adorably grumpy all the time, it probably wouldnt go over well
AC: :33 < its hard to explain, maybe cats think diffurntly, but trolls tend to be pretty cautious about expressing their f33lings when it comes to the flushed quadrant
AC: :33 < it is
AC: :33 < ummmmmmmm
AC: :33 < okay it has romantic applications but it is also something more general than that
AC: :33 < a quadrant is
AC: :33 < how do i say this!
AC: :33 < a quadrant is a thing in a group of things that consists of four similar things
AC: :33 < EXACTLY like paws!!! :DD
AC: :33 < i know, but its just not that simple. i could make someone else jealous i think, and what if he doesnt f33l the same way, and, urrgh, its so complickated
AC: :33 < maybe i just n33d to let go of the silly infatuation
AC: :33 < i think its never going to happen honestly
AC: :33 < oh?
AC: :33 < so, youre saying that maybe i will have to die to get to be with him?
AC: :33 < i hope thats not the case!
AC: :33 < but i guess you just have a different way of looking at things
AC: :33 < thank you for the advice jaspers!
