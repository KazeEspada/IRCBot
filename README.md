Aradiabot
=============
A IRC bot written in Java using the pIRCbot API. 


Description
===========
Aradiabot is an IRC bot written to perform useful commands and tasks (and perform funny commands too), while still staying in the character of Aradiabot from the webcomic, Homestuck. She is still under extremely heavy development and was designed to work with the Homestuck Radio Station created by me, IAreKyleW00t. So features may pertain to that specificially (such as the song requests).

To view all commands, load up the bot and type in "$commands".
