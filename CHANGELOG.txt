** Created: Definition Objects, DefinitionHandler, HomestuckHandler, Weather Objects, and WeatherHandler.
***$help <command> - Outputs the information about that command through a Map<String, String> (HashMap).
****DataHelper is an enum Class that has only ONE INSTANCE of itself. Holds all data needed between classes (eg: PircBotX, LogHandler, EmailClient, Google, Bot Information, etc). Holds methods that are shared between multiple classes.
*****Supported Algorithms: AES, Blowfish, DES, 3DES, RC2, BASE64, MD2, MD5, SHA1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
****** Encryption Method: BASE64 > Blowfish > AES
*******Will most likely have salts randomly generated when the bot is FIRST ran and saved in the Config File - IVSpecs will be set within the source.
